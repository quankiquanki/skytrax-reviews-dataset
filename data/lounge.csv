This is a very small airport serving about 20 flights a day and the lounge is fine and over the quality of other airlines I visited in the past.

Other lounges like Sirius in E and Jazz in D (a parallel or copy of Blues) must wait for another time (Sirius is a special lounge at terminal E - only for disabled – it is virtually a requirement for entering!). Drinks plenty – up to medium quality. Lounge hopping not always possible - even by use of SKY-gold card. Lounges prefer you stay at the lounges at departing gate but it depends on staff. Galaktika is the best of all of those I know big and smart design and colourful orange furniture with good business and smoking sections – further it has views to and outside airport. Other lounges do not have views. Views are much better from the commercial areas outside the lounges. Food is bread oriented but heating of croissants sandwiches bread rolls are possible.

The lounge is upstairs and is light elegant and airy albeit with no windows onto the tarmac. Comfy seating a separate computer area wifi throughout and attractive palm trees add a festive air. There is a circular bar that was unmanned during my visit plus a smaller self-service bar with an excellent selection of drinks and classy snacks. There is a separate screened-off TV lounge and another wine bar at the back for paying customers only. Since the lounge was brand-new it was obvious an effort was being made to impress.

Based on our visit, this is an understatement. We visited the lounge in mid-July 2015 to be greeted by an experience of very poor seating, meagre food offerings and overcrowding. Even restrooms were only limitedly available, due to cleaning which went on for quite some time. In some cases, an airport may offer venues so peaceful and reasonable that it pays to visit them instead of using the airline lounge. The Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary international exemplifies a second situation where the lounge is so inadequate and overcrowded that even poor airport venues make for a better place to wait for flights. Lounge personnel here were more interested in surfing the Internet than assisting airline customers with questions about connections or required services.","Maple Leaf","Calgary Airport","Business Class","18-07-2015","Business","2.0","1","1","","2.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0"

Gone are the days of dirty dishes and rude staff. It has been a welcome improvement. Unfortunately the YYZ MLL International lounge at the E gates seems to have been left behind. On the day I used it it was very busy with limited food offered and an unpleasant ambience. There are just too many people using the lounge many of whom have access because of their frequent flyer status. The end result is that pax who are flying on the expensive long haul flights in business class receive a mediocre experience. It's time for AC to divide the lounge into two sections one for the true international business class and ""Super Elite"" status pax and the other for the basic ""Elite"" pax and those flying on shorter route Rouge Premium. Provide a quiet area with better food for the first group and keep the current set up for the second group. My biggest wish is for AC to provide decent wifi access in its Canadian lounges.

Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a 35 minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first 15minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave. Again - it looks great but it is tougher if you are in a hurry.

We were absolutely exhausted by this time and looking forward to settling in for lunch before our 3 p.m. flight to YUL. The Lounge was very large and of course brand new. Seating was plentiful and the menu selection was excellent with a complete self-serve bar. There was a chef preparing various cooked meals however we just helped ourselves to more lighter fare as we knew we would be having lunch/supper on the flight in a few hours. Washrooms were excellent with private toilets and showers. There was also a business centre which we did not use n or did we use WiFi as it was not secure.

As usual it was a challenge finding the Lounge and the few Air Canada employees we talked to just grunted and pointed to another annex of the domestic terminal to its location - still not clear. We walked a considerable distance from our departure gate to somewhere near Gate 2 to access the Lounge. We were greeted by the same indifference from Lounge staff we experienced in our previous three ML Lounge visits in our trip to the UK; our boarding passes were scrutinized and handed back to us without comment. We walked into a somewhat small lounge with dated furniture passengers lounging about everywhere (this was about 6:30 p.m.) and almost every seat occupied. We finally found a couple of hard chairs in the walkway between the window seats and airline-style gate seats in th e back of the Lounge. We went to the self-serve food area only to find it barely stocked mostly with appetizers. Very disappointing. We were looking forward to proper meal as we knew we would not get any food service on our two upcoming flights through to YWG. The washrooms were dirty dated and in poor condition (broken panels towels all over the place). The overall condition of this Lounge appeared to be one of neglect or indifference. This would not make a very good impression on AC's frequent travellers or international business travellers. We finished up as soon as we could and left for our gate.

Staff on reception can be very friendly or very rude and inattentive - there does not seem to be an area in the middle. You can no longer get a fresh coffee and they removed the coffee machine that was installed for a few months and this is first class! The food is canteen type and rather greasy chinese food and probably best to wait for your flight to get a bite to eat. The toilets are kept clean by attendant that waits for you to tip him when you go in! The shower is tiny smells of drains and is best avoided. Furniture is tired and quite grubby and generally feel this lounge has continued to get worse and worse in the last 2 years. Avoid and go downstairs to Pizza Hut or Costa/Starbucks coffee for a nicer experience.","AIR CHINA INTERNATIONAL FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Beijing Capital Airport","First Class","","","2.0","3","3","2.0","2.0","2.0","2.0","3.0","0"

We were flying United Global First to Washington DC IAD. We had 3 hours to departure at 6:20PM. When we entered the Lounge we found it to be very warm actually hot. It is a very large lounge and there were very few people there at the time. There were about 6 people working the front desk but I never saw any Air China Agents working in the lounge. The seting was leather chairs fairly comfortable with a small table between seating for 2. There was hot food available but it didn't appeal to Western tast mostly rice and soup We passed on the food. Some snacks the kind you scoop out of a jar with a spoon. The guy who was there before us had his hand in all the jars without the spoon so we passed on them also. Next we tried the bar. Self service with very little selection. I only saw Chinese beer in the cooler about 10 bottles of the usual liquor and mixers in the cooler. There was ice but it is not a good idea to use ice unless you know it was purified. No way to know that no one to ask. There were two bottles of Chinese ""Great Wall"" brand. One was dry red and the other was a cab. We tried the cab then switched to club soda. Star Alliance airlines should inspect this lounge and demand that Air China make necessary changes to bring it up to international standards.

The lounge in Vancouver has a stunning view of the North Shore mountains - lounge in Edmonton has a fireplace - lounge in Ottawa is glass on 3 sides.

The lounge is small and clean and does offer relaxation time before boarding. One can sit in a deep cushion chair place food on the table or use the complimentary computers. Food offerings on March 19 2014 started with stale roast beef/cheese sandwiches that came from the deep freeze cheap corn chips and packaged cookies one can find in a Supermarket etc. Champagne and other alcoholic and soft drinks were available in ample quantity.

The wi-fi is slower than the general free Frankfurt Airport wi-fi and just outside the lounge is a long hallway with recliners for regular passengers to lounge in comfort. The only places to sit in the lounge for lounge customers are upright chairs. Additionally there are no bathrooms within the lounge and if you need those facilities you are directed to leave the lounge and go down the hall to use public bathrooms. Given all of this I'm not really sure why you would choose to come in to this lounge unless you would like to eat some of the simple packaged cookies or the cheese that is sitting out in warm temperatures. Very little in the way of hard liquor. No red wine on display and a single white wine in the refrigerator. There was a sparkling wine in an ice bucket that was untouched.

The reason I can think of is if you visit their lounge you would notice that it is generally occupied by Airline staff itself and after a minute or two someone will be visiting from Airline to have a snack so it is a free restaurant for them.

I was shocked to see that this is the flagship lounge of Air India in India's capital. What a shame. First the first and Executive lounges are not separate. They are separated by a barricade nthat was easily crossed. There is no wait staff even for first class passengers. When one flies Emirates or Lufthansa in first class the respective lounges provide an opportunity for a high quality sit down meal from an a la carte menu. In the AI lounge food left a lot to be desired. The bathroom was in shambles and there was no lotion. Magazine choice was non existent. Wifi was spotty and complicated. why can't they provide free wifi without the need for passwords cell phones etc ? Very absurd. And the bar service was pitiful and most of the time non existent. Again no waiters even in first class section. In summary the premium lounge in the airport shared by many airlines is similar but at least predictable in service (albeit poor). The AI lounge is awful and takes away from first class experience. The managers don't care and are never around to receive feedback leave alone make changes. Best avoided for same reason AI is best avoided. First class pax are not escorted to the plane either.","AIR INDIA MAHARAJAH FIRST/BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Delhi Airport","Business Class","","","1.0","1","2","1.0","1.0","2.0","1.0","1.0","0"

The lounge was easy to find and the ambience was quite decent with enough seating. However every aspect of service is poor. I asked for a toothbrush in the morning; after bring ignored by the lounge manager and then again by the uniformed lady I got it through the attendant but the kit seems to have been ""borrowed"" from Hotel Centaur (whose name was written on the pack). The breakfast was pathetic - very little options and the one I had Poha was cold dry and just a step above eating sand. The ketchup that was served looked like it was diluted 10 times over. The coffee and tea served were tasteless cold and unappetizing. I had to go out and eat breakfast in a restaurant outside. There is no WiFi in the lounge and they give you some sort of cards that have a validity of 45 minutes. On the day I visited even that was not available. Since I was coming from an international leg I thought of taking a shower before taking the domestic leg. When I asked the lounge manager for a towel I was flatly told that they had ""run out of towels"" - when I asked how long it will be before they can get fresh ones I was told that it will come the next day only! Since the lounge was quite empty I asked the manager how many towels he keeps a day and he said that they have a limit of 6 towels a day. I asked how they expected other guests to shower and he gave me a look that conveyed that I had exhausted my limit on the questions I can ask him. The lounge manager was very quick to refuse every request for service. He also has a bright future in the Indian Administrative system because he never forgets to treat you with disdain and demonstrate to you that he is under no obligation to provide you any service whatsoever. I am have flown Air India internationally for almost 18 years and they have managed to completely escape the service revolution that has happened everywhere in the world. The quality of service is as poor as it was 18 years back and though the faces of service staff is younger they have managed to encapsulate the same sense of apathy and disdain for passengers that existed earlier.","AIR INDIA BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Delhi Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","4","4","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","0"

There are two lounges that can be used one before security and one after. I chose to use the one after security because the lines were extremely long. The waiting area after security is very sparse but had an adequate number of seats. The lounge appeared decent from the outside. Once inside I felt I had entered into the 1970s. There were sofas and chairs that were upholstered with a flower pattern. The tables and everything else was wood (mahogany?). The two young men manning the information desk took my lounge pass. I found a seat among the many people who had already taken entire sofas to sleep on. Being a midnight flight there were many sleeping people. There were no drinks or food offered in the open. One of the young men offered water to other passengers and I had to ask for water. Later on the young man was taking the order of another passenger and finally asked me if I wanted coffee or tea. The only redeeming factor of this lounge was that the Masala Chai was decent. Other than that I felt like I had been transported back to the 1970s due to the furniture of the lounge. Also if other Indian passengers had not ordered coffee/tea I feel like I never would have been asked being the only non-Indian passenger in the lounge.","AIR INDIA MAHARAJA BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Mumbai Airport","Business Class","","","1.0","3","3","3.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0"

In the drinks department there was no chardonnay only Marlborough Sav/blanc in the white range and one brand of red (cab/sav). I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices. I got the impression that the staff just wanted the Thai travelers out of the lounge ASAP in order to close the facility for the day.

The ""colour"" palette is of dull mud brown gum-leaf grey and khaki. To add to the disappointment is that the windows are frosted over - no view. A better view is available in the public areas. The food is very basic simple presentation. Think of simple home cooking rather than restaurant quality. Even though New Zealand produces some excellent wines (and a decent selection available) they did nothing to present these in any way to encourage you to drink them or provide information about them. The bottles where just sitting in the fridge along with beers and soft drinks. The bathroom did not appear to have been updated in the past decade and it was not serviced frequently as there were no hand towels available - empty dispensers.

Soup is fine. Good range of snacks (chips nuts cookies). There is a big problem however with children - they run around unsupervised often using the pseudo-marble floors as a skating track (and this has happened the three times this year I've been in the lounge). There is no child-free area. They are also given unfettered access to the computers resulting in loud and raucous behaviour.

Arrived at the lounge at 10.15pm for our 11.45pm flight hoping to have a light meal so we could go straight to sleep once on the plane. Found staff clearing the ""trucker cafe""-buffet-style food table because ""dinner was finished."" Great. The only food available was picked-through cheese and crackers muffins (?!) and biscuits. Asked service staff for even a cup of hot soup but nope sorry not available. The coffee bar was closed as well and the only coffee/tea available was self-serve brewed. This despite the fact that there were so many people lounging around waiting for their flights - so much so that it was difficult to find any place to sit with any silence or privacy. Any free space on the sofas and tables were littered with crumbs used plates cups and glasses. Some staff were around clearing things away but hardly enough to cope with the number of passengers there. Very disappointing. Finally found a quiet spot to settle it near the back and decided to partake of the ""free massage"" for long-haul Business passengers. Approached the table presented boarding pass and was told sorry massage room was closing for the night. Quite a number of long-haul ANZ flights leave at night - including flights going to LON and LAX which have the highest fares. Why doesn't the lounge operating hours reflect this and have extended food/service hours to cater to these premium passengers? Considering this is Air New Zealand's main hub we thought the lounge here would be impressive which is why we came for our flight early.","AIR NEW ZEALAND BUSINESS CLASS (INT'L) LOUNGE REVIEW","Auckland Airport","Business Class","","","1.0","1","1","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","0"

I decided to buy one of the items on their menu, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was perfect. It was fresh and delicious, well worth the 9 bucks. Overall, both locations were excellent.

We arrived at the airport at about 06.00 (without having any breakfast at our hotel) and checked-in without problems. We passed through security and after a long walk found our way to the Admiral's Club lounge. What a disappointment the lounge turned out to be - American Airlines clearly has much to learn from British Airways on how to run a decent lounge. There was no food available that I could see (with the exception of a few bagels very small muffins and some pretzels) unless you paid for it. Furthermore there were no plates available - my wife had to ask for one and had to wait for almost ten minutes before it arrived. Just what does American Airlines think their business and first class passengers are paying thousand of pounds/dollars for? This practice of making passengers pay for food in the lounge is just cheap On entry to the lounge we were each given two vouchers for free bar drinks (how many people want bar drinks at that time in the morning?) from ""the pit"" - not high quality brands of alcohol. The lounge seats were comfortable enough but there were far too many dirty glasses and plates left on tables waiting to be collected and taken away. All in all our Chicago O'Hare Admiral's Club experience was very disappointing indeed. the service we received on our eight-hour flight to the UK was also very poor and the inflight food was absolutely terrible. It will be a very long time before we fly American Airlines business class again - we will ensure all our trans-Atlantic travel is with British Airways.","AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB LOUNGE REVIEW","Chicago O'Hare Airport","","","","1.0","1","1","1.0","1.0","1.0","2.0","1.0","0"

On my way back to London through DFW used the smaller British Airways lounge and they have no one drink voucher policy.

There are actually 2 AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase. For that I might as well step out into the airport and buy the food of my choice.","AMERICAN AIRLINES FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","New York JFK Airport","First Class","","","4.0","5","5","5.0","2.0","5.0","4.0","5.0","1"

This review is for the lounge at ORD only. Lounge amenities lacking. The only self-serve beverages are coffee/tea/water. Free food consists of supermarket type cookies and two choices of apples. The latter are acceptable due to the fact that AA flights in Business/First more than make up for this with food/beverage/alcohol service. What was especially appalling about this lounge is the restroom/toilet facilities. AA terminal restrooms are usually crowded and dirty so I though that the lounge restrooms would be clean and inviting: quite the opposite! To start there are not private stalls like the lounges at DFW/LAX. I was carrying multiple carryon bags and tried to find a stall which would accommodate them. The stall closest to the wall was occupied the next one over had a broken lock the next one over was missing the hook in which to hang bags/coats and the handicapped stall had an almost one inch gap between the door and where it is supposed to lock. The lock maybe jutted out 1/16 of an inch and opened several times when I tried to hang my bag on the door hook. Making things worse there seemed to be no air conditioning in the restroom and a male employee kept pacing the area in front of the stalls with a bag of toilet paper rolls loudly conversing on the phone in a foreign language. All of the above factors made me leave the restroom and lounge early (sweating bullets by this point) for the family restroom outside of gate H6. Not worth the money paid and I would not pay the annual membership fees for such discomfort/lack of amenities.","AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Chicago O'Hare Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","3","4","2.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","0"

In comparison to BA Air New Zealand Air Canada or other airlines Admiral Lounge has definitely room for improvement when it comes to snacks and especially entrees. There is no variety of choices but also quality and taste is not very good. Most of the time I have been there there was about 10 minutes wait for refills for everything.

Following the same penny pinching formula of most US based airlines you are given 2 tokens per passenger for complimentary drinks and after that you pay through the nose for both soft and hard drinks and food (tea coffee and water were free as were a few biscuits and apples). Compared to other airlines in Europe Australasia and the Middle East this is shabby. The lounge itself is pleasant if overcrowded.

It's only offered to first class passengers if you're traveling overseas. I was traveling first class Toronto to Chicago to San Jose - and they wouldn't let me enter. Out of curiosity I bought a 24 hour pass for $50 to see what was so special about this lounge. One would expect an airlines flagship lounge service to be very nice. The Admiral Lounge only offers crackers and cookies and there is no self-service bar. If you want anything more you have to pay for it. The bar is tended and they only offer cheap drinks and poor quality wine and beer. You have to pay for anything that actually tastes good. From the outside the doors leading to the lounges looks like heaven awaits on the other side. Don't be fooled. Amongst other things the staff is too preoccupied with their own personal concerns talking amongst themselves - usually about some negative aspect of their job. You have to wait for them to finish their personal conversations before they'll even look at you.","AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB LOUNGE REVIEW","Toronto Pearson Airport","","","","2.0","3","3","1.0","1.0","3.0","4.0","2.0","0"

The lighting (harsh neon striplights which cast a stark glare over the whole lounge reminiscent of a public lavatory) was horrible and as we had left home at a very early hour in the morning we were looking forward to a good breakfast like BA provide in their lounges. We found only pretzels and packaged biscuits available until some dry rolls containing awful tasting bacon were produced hours after we arrived and had checked in. Even the coffee was grotty and we didn't fancy alcohol at 7am. We were not impressed and our later experiences with Admiral's Club lounges at San Juan and Chicago were even worse.

I'd avoided it in the past because it was always a bit of a hike from the gate but I wanted to get some work done before my flight. My first clue that I'd made a mistake was when the agent at baggage check-in upon seeing that I'd purchased the day pass told me I was crazy for having done so. And she was right. It took nearly 15 minutes of standing at the counter in the Club to get my WiFi password and free drink voucher processed. That was disheartening but not as much as using the free drink voucher for a glass of champagne and being handed a twist off mini-bottle of sparkling wine. As you might expect it tasted terrible. The ""free nibbles"" that were provided were scarce and stale. And unlike at CDG nobody came to get me to tell my that my flight was boarding. There wasn't a single announcement made. So with 25 minutes to go before my flight I made the hike back to the gate and found that everyone had already boarded. This was a huge waste of my money and when I wrote to complain about it nobody offered a refund.

There are a wide variety of drinks available (spirits, including varieties of Japanese sake, coffee, and soda dispenser). I favor the coffee a lot.

But oh how wrong I was. Firstly I was directed to the wrong lounge by the pleasant lady at check in. She sent me to the BA lounge. Anyway once I found the Admirals Club I was greeted by the most miserable man on the planet. ""do you want wireless?"" I was asked to which I was presented with a plastic card with a scratch off back. I was also presented with a ""good for one complimentary beverage"" voucher! One drink? For the amount I paid for this ticket I would expect more than one free drink. I have never seen that in a Business Class lounge before. Anyway feeling hungry I looked through the menu and decided on a panini. $9.99. No please Hello Or thank you from the man behind the bar just a ""sign here"". ( he didn't even take my voucher so I guess I may get another free drink after all). Food arrived fast as the bar staff cook it themselves. It's a bit like starbucks!! But it took someone an hour to clear the empty plate from my table. Taste wise? I should have eaten outside the lounge. Absolute rubbish food. Bought a second beer. Cost me $6 dollars. To be honest it's a bit like sitting in a pub chain not a Business Class lounge. I think I may stick to BA next time although this is a shared flight. Forget the wifi. It takes ages to type in a 14 digit code. Do what others do AA. This is not Business Class as I know it.

The food offering is dreadful - little plastic wrapped awful cakes cheap wine and reconstituted juices. The staff are rude and officious. One only has to compare this with the BA lounges in Terminal 5 to see where they have gone wrong at every turn.

The typical Admirals Club is rather tired has a poor selection of food and drink and are often crowded. Internet access has become one of the main reasons I keep my membership. The Flagship lounges (I have experienced LHR/ORD/San Juan) are better but typically quite small. It is mind boggling to me that they do not have one at their hub in DFW - but even these are nowhere near the quality of BA/Cathay for 1st class passengers. Their shower facilities are fairly decent with Chicago being recently upgraded but again Flagship do not have these - Admirals Club only. All in all not close to international standards with some of the lounges having totally insufficient bathrooms for the capacity of the lounge (ORD G Concourse is a good example - 1 toilet for men in a club with a 100+ capacity).","AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","","Business Class","","","2.0","3","3","1.0","1.0","3.0","3.0","2.0","0"

Seating is comfortable and it is usually quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to chill and read or do work. Don't expect to get anything decent to eat though. On my last visit (almost identical to my previous 3 visits this year) - which was more than 4 hours - the offerings consisted of one small EMPTY platter with sign that said 'Sushi' one small EMPTY hot plate with sign that said 'Chicken WIngs'. Food that was actually there consisted of a handful of pretzels with orange 'cheese' paste that tasted like wax a meagre salad bar with undercooked unseasoned flavourless potato salad and four large baskets of dry bread offered with jam and butter. About 10 tiny vegetable sandwiches made an appearance for 30 seconds - but they were immediately hoovered up by patrons desperate for anything decent to munch on. Three cups of vegetable rice also appeared briefly - but it looked and tasted like it was leftover from 3 weeks ago. Oh - and lest I forget two small cereal bowls with thimble sized cookies were offered for dessert. There are also cheap paper instant noodle cups always on offer.

Food and drink selection was extremely mediocre. There was a selection of overcooked tomato pasta a huge bread mountain with toaster which nobody touched. The salad bar and grilled vegetables were depleted and obviously the most popular. No dessert except some cut pineapple and sliced oranges. Pot noodles was obvious choice for Asian travellers. Compared to the business lounges in HK London and Dubai the Asiana lounge really needs to step up. At that time in evening the last thing we want is a carb overload. Suggest you cut out all the pasta and serve cold cuts salads and a decent cheese board some chocolates or dessert of some sort and not the plastic Kraft cheese on display. If we are playing business class fares then I expect half way decent food in the lounge. If I knew it was going to be this bad I would elected to eat in one of the restaurants in the airport but unfortunately everything closes at 10pm in Incheon Airport.

On the inward journey we spent a few hours at the lounge in terminal 1 - on the return the lounge in terminal 2. While they are both decorated and laid out similarly terminal 2 is newer. The shower rooms are a little nicer the layout a littler more varied and the business centre much bigger. While Seoul has a phenomenally spacious efficient and relatively pleasant airport there is more shopping in terminal 1 than 2. I compared duty free prices though and while there are savings on alcohol and tobacco many cosmetics and clothing were exactly the same as mall prices in Canada. Some of the areas Asiana could improve would be the inordinate announcement of flights; there is no escape from the PA. The quiet relaxing area is near the showers and bathrooms and cleaners area so there is always a din. The food offerings varied sometimes generous — roast pork hot soup vegetable salads — to scant such as sandwiches lettuce and dried noodles. Drink options not great not bad; no decent wine.

This Austrian lounge is at the bottom of my list. In fact, I don't think I will bother using it again as it offers less than the airport facilities. I was using it for an hour from 9-10 am on a Saturday. The choice of breakfast items is APPALING. Bread, jam, margarine or butter, cornflakes, muesli and apples. That was it! Not to mention that the milk was not marked as skim or full fat and there was only one pitcher of milk next to the cereals. No bananas, no yogurts, no cheese - those are the (inexpensive) basics of a lounge breakfast spread from Kathmandu to Lima airport lounges. Last week I flew through Munich and was amazed at their offering. I am so surprised that the airline of such high reputation offers such low quality of lounge services.

Nevertheless the WiFi should be improved or the instructions to be made clearer on how to connect. In the central area of the lounge there is a TV showing CNN.

The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swissair logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swissair evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swissair lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.","AVIANCA (SWISS) BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW","New York JFK Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","2","3","1.0","1.0","2.0","1.0","2.0","0"

But I was rather disappointed. First the directions given by the checkin agent was go straight after security. Unfortunately there was a T-junction where the sign board had an arrow pointing UP. I asked a staff but the directions was confusing. Having heard that it was past the food court I look for this sign reach a dead end a construction area. So I backtracked and saw the food court UPSTAIRS. Going into the lift I pressed 2 the floor the agent told me. It didn't move. I try 3 and it moves. Actually the lounge is no longer after the food court but to the side especially if you take the lift. Next I looked for the toilet. I could see the female toilet but not the male one. I walked to the other end - still no toilet. Backtracked all the way to exit still no toilet. You see the male toilet is beyond the ladies but it is not visible from this direction or that. And there are no signs to overcome this. Then I went for the food. The spread was astonishingly poor. Many plates of ham and cheese. Some salad and juices. That's it for food. (I hadn't checked the alcoholic section.) I gathered some food and look for the cutlery. Not obvious again. After going around i found forks and knives but no spoon. I asked the cleaning lady and she obliged. Huge traffic during lunch time is no excuse Then I go the work area. Plugged in my video camera to recharge. Power light doesn't come on. I jiggled here and there. Still no power. So I waited for another table to be vacant. And there's power. So my verdict. Great potential. Lots of shortcomings which can be easily rectified. I hope Avianca realises that most people only use the lounge once. And some older people are not so mobile so they need good direction signs.","AVIANCA EL DORADO BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW","Bogota Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","3","3","3.0","1.0","3.0","4.0","1.0","0"

It was looking quite grubby when I visited - sitting in several different places the armchairs had crumbs and mess down the side of cushions and floor was not clean (to put it politely). Snack food okay but nothing exceptional. I guess they are measuring themselves against perhaps Lufthansa or United lounges and that is a benchmark far too low. Washrooms were okay although not much cleaner than public facilites here at terminal 1. Biggest disappointment was staff service - found them really quite offhand and lacking any customer skills or finesse.

It is the worst lounge I've ever used. Having said that it isn't quite as bad as some other reviews across the Internet might lead you to believe. We arrived about 90 minutes before our British Airways flight from Bordeaux to London Gatwick and the whole Club Europe check-in process was very friendly and smooth. We were issue with an invitation to the lounge; you then have to go through security (no fast track of course!) and present your invitation to the ""Cafe News"" on the airside. They will then give you the code for the lounge's front door. You have to enter this yourself; the lounge has no staff at all. However the member of staff at the cafe was very pleasant. There is a vending machine serving hot drinks which I found acceptable but be aware that the default choice adds sugar to everything which I did not want. There are a couple of local wines in a cooler and various spirits with soft drinks and mixers in the cooler. A few food items are available; in our case since we had a morning flight there were some quite fresh croissants and pains au chocolat which were actually quite good. The seating is rather old but not uncomfortable. The lounge itself was mercifully quiet which I suspect is usually the case for what is most probably a mainly holiday destination. Some of the tables could have used a quick clean but nothing serious here. So all in all if you can get a good price for your business class seat it may be worth it for the additional pre-flight comfort but anything like standard business class prices are definitely more than it's worth paying for this lounge.","SALON DES VIGNOBLES","Bordeaux Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","4","3","3.0","3.0","1.0","2.0","1.0","0"

The new lounge appears to have less seats than the old lounge it is narrow & cramped & you still need to leave the lounge to use washroom facilities. The refreshments are very poor nothing as improved in this area so still a very poor selection of drinks & food & snacks. The furnishings are trendy as opposed to being comfortable & functional as well as being cramped with little privacy if you want to have your own space. At the moment I would not entertain visiting the British Airways lounge until the building work has been completed towards the end of 2015 as it is not worth the effort it takes to reach the lounge after check in or leave the lounge to get to the departure gate.

I've used plenty of the major airline's first class lounges: Qantas Cathay Emirates American etc: and considering this is the First Class lounge at BA's flagship terminal; I was pretty unimpressed. Firstly the breakfast was awful. The scrambled eggs on the buffet were more milk than egg. The coffee was out of a machine: no trained Barista and the menu that was available was very limited. I also had to queue for the toilets: not a shower. Just the toilets. Maybe this can happen in the business lounge but you just wouldn't expect this in first. Then it's the little things. I sat in quite a comfy seat with decent views but I could not charge my phone as there was no USB amenities. Also they had international power outlets but not Australian/New Zealand and I had already packed my adapters in my checked baggage. These are the type of small items that with a little thought can make a big difference to one's comfort whilst travelling. Sorry BA but you've failed. I'd look at what Cathay Pacific have done in Hong Kong and Qantas in Sydney.

What a nightmare. I am a disabled passenger but I was not allowed to walk through the Concord area to the Business Lounge - I was not amused. Certainly a user-unfriendly route from fast-track to the lounge. The Business Lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly ""tired"". They have stopped providing the Daily Telegraph and at the drinks area they have stopped providing Campari. The chairs and carpets appear very ""well-used"" and some of them appear to be well beyond their ""sell-by"" dates. Food provided was so-so - good croissants but uninspiring lunch choices. When this lounge opened it was wonderful. Today it does not hold a candle to the First Concorde lounge (which I have also used on eleven occasions). Although I recommend the lounge it is with some reservations.","BRITISH AIRWAYS TERRACES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","London Heathrow Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","3","3","3.0","2.0","3.0","5.0","3.0","1"

Another gripe I had was the elevator that connects the lounge to the departure gates way too small and slow. If I was in a rush I probably would have missed my flight despite it only being 7 minutes away at Gate 21. It may be better to grab a bite to eat outside and enjoy the spacious seats at the gates if the lounge continues to be way it was when I visited.","CATHAY PACIFIC BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Hong Kong Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","4","2","4.0","4.0","3.0","3.0","2.0","0"

Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned. To be fair to BA though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably don't have much influence over how its run.

Good varieties of drinks including premium liquor and soft drinks. The lounge itself does not compare to the Wing or Pier lounges in HK but for Taipei it provides a nice oasis for travelers to eat and drink prior to their flight. It is a better alternative to the lacklustre duty free that is provided at Taoyuan airport. If there try the beef noodles in soup and not the spicy peanut sauce based noodles.

Even on the busiest weekend of the year—canonization of John Paul II and John XIII—the space was remarkably civilized. The terminal raised expectations for the executive lounge. We were flying Turkish Airlines - in Rome they use British Airways executive lounge. The lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it. Apart from a series of good abstract prints and a series of photographs of architectural details of Rome the space is clinical. Solid blocks of rectilinear grey-beige vinyl sofas and matching chairs suggest that travelers necessarily move in groups of ten -–the squares are intimidating for parties of one or two but once these islands are occupied even by a single traveler they become impenetrable by others. One side of the space is plate glass blindingly bright so only half of the seating cells can be comfortably occupied. Especially for travellers suffering from jet lag the initial unsettling affect of the anti-intimate seating and hyper lighting is subtly exacerbated of other details of the ambiance. The floor carpeted in a non-descript blue felt-like substance is not as might be expected flat. Rather it rises and falls in just such a way as to make you stumble. Internet connection is available but requires an inordinately complex set of interventions to access. Once acquired it is difficult to find one of the few plugs that is not already being used by another harried voyager. The culinary experience like the digital environment is disconcerting. We were arrived at 1 p.. lunchtime. Cereal and yogurt was on offer as well as croissants and cookies. Breakfast apparently lasts all day at the BA lounge. There was a self-serve bar which included red and white wine. The red came in a Bordeaux bottle but it tasted like it had been decanted from a box. Our empty glasses stayed with us during the entirety of our wait.","BRITISH AIRWAYS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Rome Fiumicino Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","1","2","4.0","1.0","2.0","1.0","2.0","0"

Plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side. Alcoholic drinks available on a self-service basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it (I saw it being carried out to people). The big drawback about this lounge is that it doesn't have enough power points. The only ones I could find were situated next to seats right round the L shaped lounge to the left. Also it's not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in. Loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entry/exit. Signs? The coffee is still excellent from the machine - why it's so foul onboard Club Europe is anyone's guess. My only other moan is that unless you're a frequent flyer from LGW it's not clear how far the gate is from the lounge. No map on the mobile app nor anything in the Highlife magazine.

The wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax.

Overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and I actually prefer it over the Concorde room at London Heathrow.","BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS CONCORDE ROOM LOUNGE REVIEW","New York JFK Airport","First Class","","","5.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","4.0","5.0","5.0","1"

The Copa Club is centrally located, but it is very difficult to find. The entrance is relatively small and nondescript. There is no signage to help confused passengers, and the directions given by airport employees only made matters worse. I am a retired Spanish teacher, so this wasn't a language problem. A few well-placed signs would solve this problem easily. Once the club is found, it becomes obvious that their template for airport lounges comes from the United Club. The food and drink choices are a mirror image of United's with one exception - quality alcoholic beverages are free. I would recommend the airline but not the lounge.","Copa Club","Panama Tocumen Airport","Business Class","11-07-2015","Solo Leisure","5.0","3","3","5.0","2.0","3.0","","3.0","0"

Restaurant booths were full when we were there - staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space (in the end we went to the Gordon Ramsey opposite the lounge). Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business.

It's a comfortable lounge and it didn't seem too busy even on a Friday evening. There are different types of seating including desks and tables as well as a lot of very comfortable armchairs. There is a very nice rest area which is kept in semi- darkness with beds where you can take a nap. There are plenty of drinks available including wines spirits coffee and various soft drinks. The food is a little disappointing consisting of a small range of sandwiches (a fresh batch was delivered while we were there and they seemed quite freshly made) and various other snacks. Nothing more substantial is available. There seems to be no more than 15 minutes of free wifi available which is rather disappointing for a business lounge. Together with the poor signage towards the lounge and the obvious lack of airport staff in general for the first- time visitor this lounge gets an average score from us.

Excellent lounge though! Reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff. As the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out. Full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with Peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge. Hot drinks machine was working. A good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that weren't dry or tasteless. Nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings. A good selection pastries. In terms of comfort the seating was good. The furnishings and little details gave it the signature British Airways lounge feel. Lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that you'll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats. But the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being British we need to see it to believe it - by using the free Wi-Fi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible.

I used the north south and satellite lounges and they had variations on the menus. The north and satellite lounges do have manned cloakrooms to store belongings whereas the south lounge you leave items at your own risk. The lounges were kept clean and tidy despite the constant churn of passenger use. If you are looking for peace and quiet the satellite terminal is the quietest and if you require champagne it is upon request. Shower and bathroom facilities were also very good and kept clean. Wifi is free and plenty of computers to use.

In Amsterdam you get great food snacks: good breads and cheeses croissants etc. At JFK it's basically just drinks and things that go with drinks as if no one wants to eat anything but carrot sticks and olives. I was upgraded on my next flight from JFK to DTW at dinner time and on that flight in FIRST CLASS there was just a basket of junk food of the kind you'd get at a 7/11. Delta seems to think all people want are drinks.

Recently Delta has been testing new food offerings here including soup cold sandwiches and hot and cold appetizers. The soup and sandwiches are a welcome addition and might quiet some of the criticism in these comments. Other criticisms have been the presence of children in some of the delta clubs. Personally I found the children refreshing and much more interesting than the folk that typically populate the clubs. Delta has solved that problem too as they will soon begin to charge $29 per guest including family members unless you purchase a $700 executive membership. The SEA club has a great staff especially the bartenders. The complementary alcohol though is poor quality and the Luxury Bar drinks are not cheap. The seating in this club is generally uncomfortable except for the quiet room. This lounge needs additional electric outlets in the seating areas.

I made my way over to T5B and used the lounge there - not crowded and plenty of food good wifi access free computers to use. All in all a pleasant quiet place to spend time before flight. One negative for BA: when I arrived at Heathrow a week previously - the Arrivals lounge at T5 had already closed promptly at 2pm. This seems very early given that the 2nd schedule SFO-LHR flight arrives at 2 pm.","BRITISH AIRWAYS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW","London Heathrow Airport","Business Class","","","4.0","5","5","4.0","4.0","4.0","5.0","4.0","0"

Absolutely nothing has changed - for the better that is. At the time of my visit (late afternoon) dirty crockery was strewn across the tables. The elderly male attendant did not even bother to look up when I entered so no check of my credentials and certainly not greeting. It may be that BA Jersey are trying to save on electricity but I could not find any other reason for all the ceiling lights being switched off. There are table lamps but it was difficult to read the dog-eared newspapers on the shelves. Carpets and upholstery are still filthy so no change there. I used the newly built lavatory which appeared not to have been cleaned that day. I live in Jersey and this is my local airport.

Fortunately a Delta representative happened to walk by and we were able to flag her down and she immediately helped us and we were settled into the lounge. We let her know how rude the reception is at the front and yes we called out Laura specifically. I thought it was so weird that upon seeing our displeasure with her service that Laura never apologized that her manager didn't want to speak to us and that in the end it was a Delta rep and not a Sky Team rep who ended up assisting us and providing customer service.

There's always 2 staff in Emirates uniform at check-in who are always warm and friendly and will explain everything if it's your first time. There's comfortable seating with little coffee tables to your left with a big TV and the dining area and self service bar is on the right. And I mean self service, there's no annoying staff who try to pour your drink for you. I've never had a bad meal here, the food is always excellent with plenty of choice. There's a hot buffet and always a soup and a chiller with cold starters, deserts and cheeses. They have 2 self service bar areas with a good choice of spirits, wine and champagne and fridges full of mixers, beers and water, a good coffee machine and lots of tea choices. There's the usual business area with computers and a printer and there's nice bathrooms with showers. The only negative is there's virtually no mobile phone signal.","Emirates Lounge","Birmingham Airport","Business Class","06-06-2015","Solo Leisure","8.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","5.0","3.0","5.0","1"

The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices. There's a self service bar with a good choice of spirits, mixers, beers, wine and champagne plus a good coffee machine and teas. You get well looked after on Emirates. After dinner we found another self service bar at the far end of the lounge which we had virtually to ourselves. There's more than enough comfortable seating all around. There's a good business centre and bathrooms with showers. The only negative it was too warm, the air con wasn't cool enough.

HOWEVER there are 3 blocks of male toilets and only 1 block of female toilets which I found unacceptable! They are doing refurbishments so I just hope there will be more female toilets in very near future. There were queues for female toilets and showers.

Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from 4 slices of cheese on 3 plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help!

The so called lounge is in the Jet Blue terminal which is a budget type US airline and the lounge resembles a budget type lounge. Certainly not what one would expect from an airline like Emirates.

It is fairly new comfortable clean with polite and helpful staff and excellent catering. I've used it before departures on all of the three daily flights and always found a seat. There are hot and cold buffets (except early morning): the cold buffet is especially good. The kitchen will make food on request; if you want toast and eggs for breakfast they will oblige. As I don't drink alcohol comments and ratings for the drinks are limited the tea coffee water and soft drinks which are all very good. There are only two (men's) shower stalls but they have always both been free and immaculate and the staff supply a hotel style bundle of towels. Plenty of hot water and decent pressure. The only negative point is the wifi. The connection is usually fine but can be a tad slow and difficult to connect at times of high usage.","EMIRATES FIRST & BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Manchester Airport","Business Class","","","5.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","5.0","3.0","5.0","1"

Staff completely disinterested. Soup completely cold and yet butter sachets liquid! Qantas lounge was no better than a 1960s Barnsley railway waiting room. Only in 1964 the food was better and the staff nicer in a British Rail waiting room.

Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet.

First impressions were that this is a high- quality lounge spacious and a lot more capacity than the existing lounge. Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for 65 minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here.

The Business Class lounge here is dreadful: shabby overcrowded and noisy. Going the other way you leave from Terminal 3 a new purpose-built A380 terminal. The lounge is almost as long as the terminal - departure gates for Business Class passengers are in the lounge. Not having to trek through the main concourse is a pretty good convenience. I arrived at the busy time just after midnight and left after a long layover at the next busy time just before 10am. In between the lounge was quiet spacious and very comfortable - especially the quiet area with loungers at the far end. (There were no PA announcements to disturb me for six hours as there were no flights). Even at the busy times the lounge wasn't crowded. There are two food service areas a lounge- like space on the left and a restaurant area hidden on the right with proper tables. Food and drink was okay in both areas if not inspiring. If you have a long layover at terminal 2 its worth using this lounge in terminal 3 and give yourself 20 minutes to get to the other terminal by the underground rail shuttle.

I asked a member of staff if they could make a little something up for our baby daughter and they obliged. In addition my wife asked if there was any dessert wine available (as there is on the plane) there wasn't but the gentleman behind the bar arranged for a glass to be brought through from the First Class lounge. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was very good. Unfortunately the children's room was not up to the standard of Heathrowe.

That as such was fine for me: I don't visit a lounge for food and drinks anyway (as there is decent food on the business class flight that follows) but I do visit a lounge for some peace and quiet and since there where very few comfortable seats left but an awful lot of traffic instead there wasn't much chance. Also too few facilities in the men's room also here was a small queue forming. I must add however that this was my 1st and only visit to this lounge and the time of day may have been a factor (around 15:30 local time) so it may be better at a different time of day.

After the renovation the standards have unfortunately dropped in a significant way. The two main problems are: Instead of two access routes only one is left (one set of stairs and one elevator frequently reserved for maintenance purposes). As a result long waiting lines to the lower floor delay and frustrate customers. People have to stand on the stairs for up to 15 minutes to check in. The meal & snacks area has become too congested preventing access to the food and drinks for both the customers and the staff. As a result you grab what you can or what happens to be left while trying to avoid stepping on too many toes. The staff struggles to keep the area clean and organized for the same reasons. Add boring selection in regard to hot food and salads (well everything; no changes for years) in particular from the viewpoint of most frequent visitors the supposed priority for the airline.

"etihad-airways","/lounge-reviews/etihad-airways","Etihad Airways Al Reem Lounge - Abu Dhabi Airport","M Benjamin","United Kingdom","2011-09-17","Previously Etihad gold and silver card holders used the Pearl business lounge in terminal three complete with comfy seats and smoking room but now (due to overcrowding) have to use the Al Reem lounge in the old terminal 1. All Etihad flights to Europe and Asia arrive and leave from the new T3 so this becomes awkward. On arrival you have to bypass security and walk (10 mins) to the old terminal and the lounge. This lounge is not a patch on the T3 lounge with a very limited food selection (drinks are fine). There is no comfortable seating area and no papers to pass the time. The next problem is there is no smoking room so you must use the smoking room in the far corner of T1. Then of course to catch your flight head back to T3 and go through security which becomes more of a muddle if another flight arrives as you do - as nobody knows where they are going and can cause another delay.","ETIHAD AIRWAYS AL REEM LOUNGE REVIEW","Abu Dhabi Airport","","","","3.0","2","3","4.0","2.0","2.0","3.0","4.0","0"

The lounge turns out to be the New Zealand Airlines ""standard"" lounge. This is very much not what we expect when we pay for First Class. It's a nice enough lounge crowded despite a quiet night at the airport (I'd hate to see it on a slightly busy night!) but nothing more. Would not reach Business Class standards for any other airline. As we sit in the lounge we are not planning to fly Etihad again. There's a chance for catch up on the flights and in the other ports but really we've made a decision to fly First Class because we want ""First Class"" funnily enough! This is not a First Class lounge and as stated above I'd be disappointed if I'd paid Business Class for this. Part of the real pleasure of starting a holiday is sitting back in the lounge with that first glass of champagne. We last travelled Emirates and while they didn't have a dedicated First lounge (shared with Business) the facilities food and champagne are great on board. This is the first time I've ever bothered to write such a review which reflects our disappointment. Etihad has a fair bit of catching up to do at this early stage. There's no way that we'll depart Melbourne with Etihad again. Do what Air France do escort your First Class passengers (in CDG at least) to the lounge make sure they're comfortable and come and get them when it's time to leave. If you're going to ask for 5-10 times the fare make the customer feel a little special!","ETIHAD AIRWAYS LASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Abu Dhabi Airport","","","","2.0","3","3","3.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","2.0","0"

I support other reviews about the inadequate layout of bathrooms and showers - the lounge is simply not good enough for a 4-star airline when showers and bathrooms do not have cold water water pressure is pesky and you have to wait in line for a free bathroom.","EMIRATES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Dubai Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","5","5","5.0","3.0","2.0","0.0","4.0","1"

What makes this seem even worse is that most Garuda flights to Australia leave Bali very late in the evening. Customers arrive at the lounge after a late checkout from their hotel, feeling tired, looking forward to catching a few hours sleep on the 'flat bed', it is reasonable to assume that they may wish to enjoy a few quiet drinks and a light meal before hopping onto the plane. There are some single armchairs, no tables for putting food/ drinks on, very few power outlets, poor reading materials, no private areas, with the food choices/presentation befitting a canteen. Luckily I had read that it was possible to get a wine/ beer if you know that you must ask for it.  This is all such a pity because the actual flying experience is very good and quite comparable to other airlines charging similar prices for their premium travel.","Business Class","Denpasar Bali Airport","Business Class","11-07-2015","Couple Leisure","1.0","1","1","1.0","2.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1"

"gol","/lounge-reviews/gol","Gol Linhas Aereas Business Class Lounge - Rio De Janeiro Airport","M Rego","Brazil","2013-12-21","The Smiles lounge in Terminal 2 Rio de Janeiro (GIG) International Airport opened in 1999 as the VARIG main lounge in Brazil (Smiles is the name of Varig's frequent flyer program now with GOL Airlines). At that time it was the best South America lounge and was used by Star Alliance (Lufthansa United and of course Varig). It was an outstanding lounge with separated areas for first class and business class showers smoke room plenty of reading materials excellent beverages and high quality food. In 2008 Varig went out of business and GOL acquires Varig routes mileage program and VIP lounges. Strangely as GOL uses the Terminal 1 they continued using these lounge in Terminal 2 so it is impossible to board a GOL flight and use its own lounge. The lounge is used by a lot of airlines (Lufthansa United US Airways Diners Club card menbers among others). The good part is that as a big lounge it never get crowded they have good (a bit used) furniture and luxury res trooms. Unfortunately the first class section is now closed the drinks offered are cheap and the food minimal.","GOL LINHAS AEREAS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Rio De Janeiro Airport","Business Class","","","4.0","5","4","4.0","3.0","3.0","3.0","4.0","1"

Not a bad facility - not the best but serves its purpose. Gets really crowded in the peak morning departure times but quiet at other periods. Staff quite friendly but not much chat with customers. A fair choice of hot and cold food but needs to be improved to match airlines such as Malaysia Cathay Singapore etc. Small smoking room area nice bar area at one end and 2 internet terminals = wifi not working when I visited the lounge.

The lounge charges access in chunks of 3 hours each and when you have a 7.5 and a 10 hour layover as I did that adds up. Sleeper seats at one end of the lounge but the lights have been positioned so as to shine directly into one's eyes and Gulf Air has to discover the concept of eye shades whether on their aircraft or here. The lounge does provide blankets and there is also a shower available to freshen up. While you will be told at check in that flights are not called the reverse is true - some flights are called (very disturbing to sleep when there are no earplugs available!) on a very odd seemingly random basis. The desk staff is obliging while service staff in the lounge tries to be unobtrusive but fails miserably clattering dishes and glassware making a lot of noise when replenishing food and drink etc.","GULF AIR BUSINESS CLASS DILMUN LOUNGE REVIEW","Bahrain Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","3","4","3.0","3.0","4.0","2.0","3.0","1"

I needed good wi-fi and some good breakfast. I paid £GBP35 each for the two of us. Very friendly staff and club lounge was immaculate with fast wi-fi. However at about 10.00am the remains of what was breakfast was cold and congealed at the self service food bar. I asked in the form of a complaint about the state of the breakfast bar. I was offered a fresh coffee (very good) by one of the girls and told that when the chef returned from his break that he would prepare us some breakfast. This he did. We were offered a plain omelette or some 'fresh' frittata. We opted for the frittata. Two small slices each with no accompaniment. Very disappointing and not worth the money we had paid. Even with the wi-fi and a total of 4 coffees GBP70 was a lot to pay.

You can access this lounge if you are in business or first class on Iberia or another oneworld airline or have oneworld emerald or sapphire status through your frequent flyer program. So though it seems many can access this lounge it is not a problem as the lounge is needlessly large with two symmetrical wings accommodating many at a time. Overall this lounge was fantastic as it was very spacious and comfortable with areas to eat work relax and even a separate sleeping room with privacy dividers. The bar was well stocked and contrary to the Sala Dali lounge I used in the main terminal 4 this had a well stocked buffet with many different options. However I did not like that in this lounge you must ask for Internet cards from the staff at the reception where you scratch off and enter a c ode that you enter in your device. This would be okay but it only last 30 minutes before you need to repeat the process. That being said the Internet speed is very fast. The staff did a good job keeping the food and drink well stocked and the whole area well kept but while they got the job done they didn't seem as though they really wanted to be there. Overall this is definetly a nice place to spend some time before a flight and if I was eligible to use the lounge again I would definetly take the time to do so.","IBERIA VELAZQUEZ BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","","Business Class","","","4.0","4","5","5.0","5.0","4.0","3.0","4.0","1"

This was a pleasant place with several defined areas. Very light and bright with views across the airport. It was a busy time of day with many long- haul flights departing but there was plenty of room. A good selection of hot and cold food as well as drinks. The only thing I noticed lacking were the toilets - too few and not to the same standard as other OneWorld carriers. On our return we used the lounge in T4. This seemed smaller but was still comfortable with a couple of unusual water features and views of the airport especially the impressive terminal roof structure. The food and beverage selection was noticeably more limited than in the T4S lounge. We made use of the shower facilities which were very good apart from the fact that the hot water lasted for 1 minute. When I queried this the attendant informed me that the boiler was unable to cope when all 6 showers were working at the same time.

"iberia","/lounge-reviews/iberia","Iberia Sala Vip Business Class Lounge - Las Vegas Airport","James Slocombe","","2009-05-04","VIP Sala lounge again disappoints. The general condition of the lounge is still average with a large seating area and a view (albeit obscured) across the runway. Some of the furniture is worn especially the chairs in the popular locations (near the windows). The TV despite being a large LCD is never really utilised - being tucked away in a corner on channel TVEspana without sound. When I asked to hear the TV (the normal lounge lady wasn't on duty today) the new lounge staff didn't speak English so I had to convert to Spanish. My Spanish is pretty good but I do expect the airport staff - especially lounge staff - to understand English and respond to me in that language if that is the language of my choice. It didn't set us on the right footing. I was told that sound would disturb others so she couldn't change the volume. So what is the point of the TV then? I asked. I got shrugged shoulders. I expressed my displeasure and walked off for a coffee. The coffee was cold. So I went back to the lounge staff. She solved the situation by taking my coffee to the kitchen and (I assume) putting it in the microwave. The cup was too hot to hold! Despite the coffee the bar/alcoholic drinks selection is superb. Even the soft drinks shine bright - Coke without caffeine Coke zero Fanta milkshakes fruit juices etc. all being stocked among the usual collection. By far the best collection of cold drinks in one lounge I've seen. However the food is dire. In fact it could be described as peanuts. Not even an apple or a rotting banana. Nothing except peanuts and a tea-biscuit. Compare this to the Sala lounge at TFN a smaller more regional airport serving mostly national Spanish routes and Tenerife North wins hands down. They even have small sandwiches and a selection of cakes at TFN - but in LPA no!","IBERIA SALA VIP BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Las Vegas Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","2","2","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","1.0","0"

Was not disappointed. It's not a ""huge"" place but enough room for all on a Saturday afternoon dealing with a variety of flights. The self-serve drinks were varied and adequate the food skewed a bit to Asian spicy (for China Airlines pax?) and the seating comfortable and varied. A nice view of the apron & planes to boot. The only downside was the staffer on desk duty who was quite perplexed on how to deal with our Diner's Club cards had to ask in the back and in the end (as per my statement) I was charged for 3 guests instead of 3 free card admissions. (now under dispute for a refund). Ironically we were flying KLM and ran into a rather rude KLM staffer who was flogging $35 passes to all & sundry in the check-in area. Said our DC cards would not get us in. (yes they do that lounge desk girl not withstanding). That being said the guest rate for Diner's is only usd$28 or about cad$30. For about the same you can get into the Plaza Premium lounge right across the hall from Crown.

Incheon is a huge airport and so the lounge is necessarily huge too although it is cleverly set up is two areas separated by the lift shafts toilets etc. Comfortable chairs everywhere but largely lined up as if in a waiting room. Fantastic views from massive glass onto the tarmac apron. The catering was astonishing in its pausity. One unrermakable red and one unknown (and don't care too) white no bubbles of any sort a couple of self-serve draft beers water came in juice pouch things reminiscent of 1990s economy class meal trays. There was a non-descript pumpkin soup without bread a couple of unappetising salads a couple of pot noodle things (self-serve) a couple of juices and thats about your lot. Empty glasses and plates hung around for a long time including a beer mug on a table that was there when we wrrived and was still there when we left 2 hours later. Toilets were roomy and clean a must-visit to have a play with the electric flush bidet and warm air arrangement. Wifi free without the need of a password and was quick enough for the few emails and bit of browning I did.

What use is it to take a shower only to sweat through a shirt before you leave the shower room? At first I thought it was just me because I overheat easily but watching other passengers leave the shower area they were all red faced and sweating. Then there's the obvious issues with cleanliness the showers I've used have all had mould there is no shower curtain so the water splashes out onto your luggage and all over the floor. Add to that no wash cloths one towel and no floor mat and it is an entirely unpleasant experience. I've given them a few opportunities but from here on out I'm just going to go without a shower; remaining dirty is preferable to using these facilities. Then there's the staff on every occasion I've been to this lounge some KLM employees are courteous but most are dismissive rude and not the least bit interested in customer satisfaction. KLM service has been falling steadily over the years and it is apparent that things are near a breaking point as obvious budget cuts and lack of planning/staff training for non-aircraft positions doesn't rank more than a single star.

"lufthansa","/lounge-reviews/lufthansa"," - Washington Dulles Airport","Michael Bucka","Germany","2015-07-27","A warm welcome from Lufthansa Lounge Staff. Lounge is split into two sections, one larger for business and one smaller for first. It is one of my preferred lounges as it has a direct connect thru a door to the jet bridge of the plane. Food and wine is excellent for a lounge, where the seating area for first can improve. As first class passenger, you can order wine and food from a menu and get it served on your table. For business class there is a food and bar with different kind of warm and cold food available. I got my food served right on the boarding call and the ground staff gave me another 15 min to finish as we were good on time.  Overall great service.","","Washington Dulles Airport","Business Class","27-07-2015","Solo Leisure","10.0","3","5","5.0","5.0","5.0","5.0","5.0","1"

The food and beverage selections were ample and tasty. The most important aspect however was the Lufthansa staff. There was a major problem with my reservation and ticket that didn't become apparent until after check-in, security, and passport control. When I went on-line to see if the adjacent seat was still open, I discovered that my assigned seat showed as unoccupied. The Lufthansa staff in the lounge spent 30 minutes calling back and forth to various United Airlines agents to resolve the problem. I will be eternally grateful to this staff and to Lufthansa in general. If I we're mean and petty, I would complain that this lounge is located in an interior space and offers no view of tarmac or runway. Nevertheless, if the situation boils down to viewing airplanes or getting to board a plane on which you thought you had a confirmed seat, I will go with the latter. Kudos and a thousand thanks to Lufthansa.","Senator Lounge","Munich Airport","Frequent Flyer","17-06-2015","Solo Leisure","10.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","4.0","5.0","5.0","1"

Entrance staffing is odd. Non-LH entrance check leaves the two LH lounge dragons free to communicate nonstop. Which they do. Not by way of greeting guests more like ""nonstop them"". Weird choices of hot food: Both dishes were made of pork on both visits highly Muslim-friendly. The longest mobile-phone conversation clearly audible was when a Sky Chefs employee answered her phone to discuss her Sunday lunch. At least it sounded more interesting than what Sky Chefs offered in the lounge. Empty trays used to be refilled at faster speeds so your selection may be drastically reduced during a short visit. Empty dishes are removed from tables at infrequent intervals. Sky Chefs and LH offer a consistent experience: They present themselves as self-serving organisations which will accommodate customers albeit grudgingly and only once done with themselves.","LUFTHANSA SENATOR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","","Business Class","","","3.0","4","3","4.0","1.0","4.0","5.0","1.0","0"

Sofa seats were arranged in lines and close together. Buffet choices very limited. Everything was self service much like a canteen. Glasses so small probably to discourage one from taking too much thus necessitating frequent trips for refills. I stood there for 3 glasses of juice before I moved off with a 4th. That's how small the glasses were. Tables while cleared of glasses and plates were not wiped down. I saw just one staff clearing tables. I did not realise there was 2 other counters serving food. There was no signboard to the shower/washrooms. Inside the shower stalls were not clean bits of hair left behind and why is the floor in the shower area level with the changing area.

The newly renovated lounge had a cheap mess hall or school canteen feel to it as the chairs and tables were plonked in lines and rows in a big open area (not to mention the bland high ceiling) to maximize the capacity. As a result no 'personal space' and very crowded as everybody was close to each other. Chairs not comfy. No sign to the toilets had to ask staff for it. The toilet was so basic and small. Food selection adequate but not extensive. It's understandable due to their religion practice they set up the bar way off the main dining area and very close to the main entrance and had a walk a fair bit to get a glass of drinks.

What a let down. Trying to find a seat was the first obstacle my wife and I encountered and when we finally did trying to locate staff to clean the area was our next. Requesting use of the showers was met with a courteous and immediate response of yes. However when I entered through the doors it was like the area had not been serviced since the first flight of the day. No toilet tissue to be found unless you raided every cubicle prior. And the floors needed a hose down. Showers only saving grace was that the water pressure and temperature was very good as they were not very clean to begin with. With half an hour before boarding MH2 to LHR I decided to have a drink at the bar by the entrance to lounge. Selections are only average at best with no champagne only a French sparkling but that was no bother as I knew the best was to come on board. To wrap up the experience of what is meant to be their flagship lounge I have noticed its gradual decline since I first started using this service on numerous occasions since 2000. I will be returning from LHR mid Jan and look forward to experiencing the Golden Lounge of Terminal 4 as I have heard great reviews of this one.

Food selection was very good; the alcohol choices were more than extensive. Staff with a few exceptions was very helpful. The cigar lounge (smoking area) for some unknown reason is much larger than the computer area. There were often people waiting to use the handful of computers but no one waiting to use the smoking lounge; at times the WiFi wasn't working adding to the computer delays. Because of the personal/financial security issues with wireless connections I would have expected the first class terminal to use wired connections in the computer cubicles with WiFi (with WPA2 for wireless security) in the rest of the building. Separate cubicles for people with their own laptops are needed so they do not tie up the very limited number of computer/desk cubicles. The fact that the computer cubicles are several steps higher than the main floor level is a design flaw being a hassle for passengers with mobility issues heavy luggage etc. Transport to the plane is a great feature in such a large airport although their policy of waiting until the last minute for this service depends on no slip ups and carries ""just in time"" behavior to far. My driver was about to get my luggage from the trunk of his car when I questioned the model of Airbus we had just parked under ( he had taken me to the wrong gate). If major European airports would use the same gate numbers inside the terminals as outside the terminals it would remove this needless complexity.

I had a massage in the small spa which I paid extra for but it was excellent. The service was attentive but the quality of alcohol on offer was not the best; no premium whiskey or gin and the wine was a little cheap. The main room of the lounge was very busy in the evening and had it not been for the private room I would have been very disappointed to have been put there.

Great large chairs to relax in. Food choices good but they should not serve items like fried fish pieces in a food warmer and have it closed - these items tend to harden up and become a real challenge for your teeth! Drinks selection for alcoholic beverages had a bartender service which you had to use which I dont really appreciate - I would prefer a self service bar but only because I'm more used to it. Noodle bar was very nice. There was also a children's play room Surau Prayer room and a massage service corner- but you had to pay for every treatment or massage available - unlike Thai AIrways BKK massage lounge which gave business class passengers a free 30 min massage. Would have been good if MH offered that. The bathrooms were nice but toilet amenities were not 5 star standard. Previously MH provided L'Occitane and Aigner toiletries but this is no longer the case. In all a great lounge - much much better than the Business class lounge at the satellite building less people which means your chances of getting to use the shower is quite high and also more peace of mind! Only 1 criticism - too many staff on duty - wherever you walk they follow you like as though they're keeping a look out just in case you get up to no good! I know they are only there to see if you need any service but don't overdo it.

"qantas-airways","/lounge-reviews/qantas-airways","Business Lounge - Sydney Airport","T Savage","Australia","2015-07-22","The Qantas international terminal business class lounge is a lazy imitation of it's counterparts. There is a lack of service generally, the bar is self service and the variety of food offerings are minimal. The lounge seems to have more in common with the lounge at the leisure destination on the Gold coast than the Qantas lounge in Singapore. Traveling with a young child, I headed for the kids corner to keep our daughter entertained as we prepared for our flight. In this case the 'corner' was very much that, distant from the lounge proper so that a responsible parent flying solo with their kids is unable to get away to the bar or food counter to get any meals without packing everything up and lugging it all with them. There was no offer from the lounge staff to watch our bags, entertain the kids briefly or to bring any food or drinks. What was available in the kids corner was adequate but a few TVs and some toys and beanbags are not especially creative or novel. These small touches make a big difference.

Unsure if this was usual given it was the end of Australian school holidays. Food was limited, but fresh and of good quality. Once again the lounge was heavily congested, so this may account for the limited availability of food.

There are very few sleeper chairs around despite its size. The sleepers are found only next to the entrance to the lounge and just above the common area of the airport and near a huge billboard. So despite its intended use, it is not only noisy, you get lots of flashing lights from the nearby huge billboard. Despite having many staff around, nobody comes around to offer you drinks or to top them up. I was at one of the sofa seats downstairs and asked one of the staff if I could get orange juice. His answer  ""upstairs sir"". Not entirely incorrect but not very helpful. As compared to their lounge at Heathrow airport where the staff are not only attentive but much more helpful than these lot at Hamad airport, this lounge just doesn't cut it for me. However, food wise, they've got it covered well. From the restaurant upstairs to the sandwich bar downstairs, it is vey good. A tip for those having meals at the restaurant upstairs - there is a menu from which you can order food if you do not want to take your food from the buffet table - the staff just don't tell you about it until you ask for the menu. The lamb chop and the beef choices are excellent from this menu. The shower facilities are excellent if you can get past the heat - seems that there is no aircon in the shower rooms. Wifi connection is patchy at best. I've never been able to get a connection to view my home and office cameras in all the times that I've been there. I love Qatar Airways. I just hope that service improves at this lounge as I invariably spend a lot of time at this lounge waiting for my next flight.","Al Mourjan","Hamad  Doha Airport","Business Class","13-06-2015","Solo Leisure","6.0","3","4","4.0","4.0","3.0","3.0","2.0","1"

The smaller frequent flyer lounge has uncomfortable seating and very poor selection of food.  Undermines the point of belonging to a frequent flier programme with lounge access. On my return to the lounge at 3pm I was told they had ran out of champagne and spirits apart from Bacardi. There would be no more until a store was to be opened at 9pm. The point of going for an indirect flight with Qatar was because I had thought I would be looked after in the lounge.

The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only 9 showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark. Here's hoping the new First lounge makes amends when finished.","QANTAS / ONEWORLD FIRST & BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Los Angeles Lax Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","1","4","4.0","3.0","3.0","4.0","4.0","1"

Also a good selection of spirits and liqueurs. The food on the other hand is terrible. Qantas should be ashamed to offer this level of food to business customers. You could be forgiven in thinking that you are eating a sizzler. Actually that would be better. The toilets are clean but the place has a little bit of age.

I'm sure the a la Carte restaurants are excellent but my wife and I had less than 2 hr stopover and after you've made the lengthy walk from the gate had a freshen up etc the only thing we had time for is a cool beer and a selection from a quick and easy 'help yourself 'buffet (sandwich etc). The trouble is that this does not seem to exist because the food and drink section is located at the far end of the lounge and you have to put in orders for tailor made sandwiches. We did not have the time for that so downed a beer and left. Surely it would be possible to put a small selection of buffet sandwiches nachos crisps nuts etc for people who were in our position ? The lounge gets very busy around 11pm to 1 am and it was pretty difficult to find two seats together during that time though when we left it was a lot less crowded.","QATAR AIRWAYS ""AL MOURJAN"" BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Doha Airport","Business Class","","","4.0","3","5","3.0","3.0","5.0","5.0","4.0","1"

But it is too big and loses its exclusive feel. There are some comfortable leather sofas but too many of the seats are uncomfortable. There are two restaurants serving good buffet food which is of good quality but the Heathrow Qatar lounge has a superior offering with cook to order dishes. As Qatar Airways treats this airport as a hub with potentially long transit periods then a few more facilities should ideally be provided such as a spa and lounger type seating allowing you to have a more comfortable sleep. After paying good money for a business class flight I don't feel I should have to pay good money for a transit hotel. As M Clarke mentioned in the review below  there are loads of staff who hang about doing not a lot I don't want to be fussed over but it would be nice to be offered a drink or something.

Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from 4 slices of cheese on 3 plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help!

Every time I arrive here I try a different seat - there is not a single comfortable seat in the place; there are a couple of nice leather sofas that look really nice but I've never been able to get near them because they're always 'full'. There are weird modern seats (very 60s - they look great) that are too low and you have to virtually lie in them or odd seats (that are at least higher) with big 'conservatory type' surrounds but they really aren't that comfortable. Then there are the seats beside the very fancy looking computer monitors that are at a completely unrealistic angle for use but although these seats look vaguely comfortable it's like sitting in a corridor. There isn't a scrap of carpet anywhere that I can see. There's what looks like a nice restaurant about a quarter of a mile away (seems like with the up and down ramps) and several tea and coffee stations and then at the opposite end to the restaurant is a deli. The old Ppremium terminal at Doha was lovely - nice people would pass by and ask if you'd like a sandwich and bring it to you with a glass of something. This place is absolutely crawling with really lovely helpful staff but they don't seem to actually do anything. Worst of all there is NO SPA free or otherwise unless you check into a hotel no hairdresser either. For a lounge purporting to be world class this is way off I think. I would happily pay for a massage and a shampoo any day of the week but there's nothing. I spoke to a member of staff this evening and was bemoaning the fact that you have to zigzag all over the place to get anywhere and that I loved the old lounge and she said she couldn't count the number of people who had said that. I love Qatar Airways but this lounge is a bit of a fail for me - a great shame because I spend about 4 hours here every couple of months.","QATAR AIRWAYS ""AL MOURJAN"" BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Doha Airport","Business Class","","","4.0","1","5","4.0","4.0","4.0","4.0","5.0","0"

Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the 5th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the 3rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.","QANTAS ""ONEWORLD"" FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Los Angeles Lax Airport","First Class","","","3.0","3","5","4.0","2.0","3.0","3.0","4.0","0"

As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water.

The lounge has 2 dining facilities several snack areas and bars lots of seating a business area and as with its old premium lounge a lot of staff being helpful. Big and airy it is open to the new terminal but the noise did not seem to be a problem.

Whoever designed this lounge has obviously never had to do business in an airport lounge. It has been transformed into a noisy cafeteria styled open lounge. The hard surfaces (walls and floor) create a vast noisy cavern with no consideration for acoustics. Qantas has completely overlooked the business class traveller here. There are no work stations or desk areas and if you need to print anything you have to go to the check in desk to collect your private and personal documents. I'm standing at a chest height bar trying to use the laptop as every table is full. If I sit down my hands are at shoulder height trying to type.

The gelato bar was a nice touch - only 6 varieties but a nice after meal palette cleanser. There are ample Australian wines (no Champagne) top shelf spirits (but no malt whisky) international and Australian beers and soft drinks. A barista is present to make coffees. The staff were extremely pleasant - perhaps because of the early afternoon lull they had more time to interact with the few passengers waiting for the late afternoon flight to Dubai/LHR and were happy to have a chat.

Generally cannot fault the Premium Terminal. There probably is not a better lounge than QR's Terminal. However they have raised the expectation too high that it is hard to meet the expectation.

However when you cannot even find a vacant seat and a request to a member of staff for help is responded to with a dismissive wave of the arm. It is evident that they cannot cope with volume and the purpose of the patrolling staff is rather lost on me.

The business class lounge was quite busy when I arrived so I thought I’ll find a seat visit the restaurant when the crowds were less - big mistake as I fell asleep and by the time I awoke they’d finished serving meals. Although you could get drinks I missed a very nice looking mutton dish. The lounge was almost empty during the night and only began to fill up again early the following morning when more flights stared to arrive. The service from the staff was wonderful - somebody walking around checking you were okay. I’d only been awake a few minutes before a young lady arrived with a blanket.

"royal-jordanian-airlines","/lounge-reviews/royal-jordanian-airlines","Royal Jordanian Airlines Business Class ""crown"" Lounge - Amman Queen Alia Airport","I Dror","","2009-01-20","Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. Newly built (open for about 4 months at the time) large and boasting high-end features such as bedrooms along with high-end features one can expect to find in a flagship lounge. We had a long transfer at AMM (originally scheduled for 12 hours which ended out being 19 hours due to RJ technical problems) so were looking forward to a good lounge to make the wait less taxing. The first glitch occurred when staff at the counter attempted to deny us entry to the lounge saying that we should only come to the lounge 2-3hrs before our flight. When we pointed out to them the complete absurdity of this request given that we were on transit between two RJ flights and that this goes against the Oneworld regulations the matter was settled. However this was a poor welcome if we ever saw one. The so called bedrooms are a paid service at $50 for the first four hours then $20 per hour. Fair enough though a bit pricey for a long stay (and a bit cheeky to price the first segment at 4 hours when they try to deny entry only 2 hours before the flight). We had a look at a room which included a double bed shower and a cupboard (some 25 sqm I would say). We went to confirm that we wanted the room (was traveling with my wife pregnant of 6 months at the time) and were told that the rooms are considered single rooms and under no circumstances can be let out to more than one person. Again I stress that the room clearly had a double bed but we failed to get anywhere with this and were told that this is a clear order from “senior RJ management”. Why RJ went to the trouble of building and designing such rooms is questionable given this policy but at least this should be clearly flagged on their website when they talk of this so that other couples do not plan to book this service and make alternative arrangements. The lounge offers quiet rooms with some 6-7 armchairs in a relatively dark and quiet area adjacent to the bedrooms. However we found these very uncomfortable to attempt to sleep on and ended up leaving the lounge to a nearby hotel to get some sleep. In the morning there was a nice yet modest buffet (cold items only). In the evening there were three hot dishes. None too appealing but ok to snack if hungry. A separate staffed bar in a separate corner with less options that one finds in most other large lounges but large enough to cover basic requests. Infrastructure impressive and clearly RJ invested a lot in creating the lounge. However it is a bad sign that only 4 months after opening there are already issues with core features. For example there are some 12 individual sofas with personalized TV screens and high-end headsets. When we tried to use them we found the volume level unbearably loud. We tried another station. Same thing. When we asked the RJ staff we were told that all the TVs were like this and there is nothing to be done except to hold the headsets some 50cm away from the ears. Personally I find this pathetic and a miserable design/execution of a key feature of a lounge. I could go on but I think the message is clear - Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. My gut feeling is that with time as the new furniture and excitement wears down this will rapidly become a B-rated lounge at best.","ROYAL JORDANIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS ""CROWN"" LOUNGE REVIEW","Amman Queen Alia Airport","Business Class","","","","0","0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0"

The lounge was too small for the amount of people present. At either end of the lounge were televisions although it was very difficult to hear them over the noise of the people. The smoking section wasn't screened off and I could hear people complaining about the smoke in the non smoking areas. Drink in plentiful supply including alcoholic juices tea etc and snacks were available although these were mainly cakes dates etc. It was surprising that even though there were so many people the lounge was tidy and plates and cups were cleared often. The staff clearing the plates were friendly but the staff behind the bar area didn't seem as friendly but they certainly weren't rude. It was certainly a retreat from the main terminal and as you get refreshments for 'free' to be honest even though it was very full I cannot complain and I did enjoy being there.","ROYAL JORDANIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Amman Queen Alia Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","3","4","4.0","3.0","0.0","3.0","4.0","0"

Once in the terminal there is a limited duty free shopping area (much smaller than the main terminal's) and a few gates. Upstairs is the lounge area for premium passengers. Service is good as you are greeted immediately upon arrival. From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge. The business class lounge has a large dining area with actual table service. Food selection was excellent for a lounge - with actual main dishes and an endless variety of premium drinks. Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd. Overall a very comfortable lounge but not much to do in the terminal for long stopovers.","QATAR AIRWAYS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Doha Airport","Business Class","","","5.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","4.0","5.0","5.0","0"

First lounge is an absolute haven - great selection of food and beverages comfy chairs and sofas sleep cabins if required spa and also a smoking room for those who require it. Good internet access although only a limited number of fixed terminals available - Wi-fi is free throughout though. Business lounge is similar to first but lacking in the sleep cabins and naturally much more crowded than First lounge. In both lounges staff are friendly and helpful and come around to announce your flight personally. Feeling a bit off-colour and in need of some antacid the staff directed me to the clinic where I was soon fixed up and got the feeling that they would have attended to pretty much any condition from which I was suffering. I think this is a great idea that should be widely copied. If you travel business class do be aware that the bus takes you to the regular terminal first so make sure you stay on board until you reach the premium terminal. This is no issue if you arrive first class as you are whisked from the plane in a 7-series BMW straight to the premium terminal.","QATAR AIRWAYS FIRST / BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Doha Airport","Business Class","","","5.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","5.0","5.0","5.0","0"

New terminal is very impressive visually and well maintained. Reading material limited (on way back through early in the morning there wasn't any at all.) Would prefer a self service bar for wine/beers etc - there was a somewhat limited range of wines in the fridges available and no menus/drinks lists. Didn't look for or use PC so can't comment on Internet access. No announcements made staff wander round giving flight information and you can be sat some way away from screens giving flight info. Staff friendly enough but didn't volunteer any assistance. Given limited time available didn't have time to eat but there seemed to be a good variety of hot food available.

Aside from fewer people and prettier light fittings almost everything else is the same. The so-called Neil Perry signature food selection amounts to little more than a plate full of fancy party pies. The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean.

Whilst the Qantas First Class lounge in Sydney is very nice with its openness and design the lack of attention to detail lets it down. The first impression upon entering the main lounge - a dirty floor going up the escalator to the top floor. Toilets - not only was the floor filthy beyond belief but two out of the four toilet stalls were either not flushed or had excrement in them. When I informed reception of this they told me that they just had a lot of flights leaving. Is this suppose to be an excuse? If they knew this then someone should have been right on it. Nearly half of the computers did not work. One had a virus warning flashing on the screen! The restaurant had an excellent selection of food which was tasty and made to order. The wine selection was the best I have seen. Also the spa centre was brilliant! I had the best face and neck massage that I can recall. Although my wife was less impressed with her manicure.

The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find.

I tried the United Airlines lounge first as I heard some positive reviews. However also decided to try the Singapore Airlines lounge. I arrived at around 10.15am. As well as the expected English breakfast buffet, I was glad to see Chicken Sambal on offer. It was really excellent: chicken on the bone (or rather falling off the bone) and I added rice, hard boiled egg and chilli - I really really enjoyed it. I accompanied my brunch with a glass of champagne. The decor was very agreeable, lots of brown leather seating and a good view of the apron. The lounge is not as big at the UA lounge and it does not offer as much natural light. But the decor and food offering makes it a better lounge for me.","Business Class","London Heathrow Airport","Business Class","18-06-2015","Business","9.0","5","5","5.0","5.0","","","5.0","1"

What was on offer was cold meat pie cold grilled sausages curries that were lukewarm (beef rendang that did not even look like the real thing) Chinese congee that had very few condiments and a few other dishes of similar temperature. All served buffet style and obviously as time went by the food becomes less appetizing. Considering they have the Australian consulting chef Matt Moran on SIA's culinary panel why did they not use his talents to come up with something more original like gourmet appetizers rather than the same old tired food formulas.

On arrival at the lounge counter staff were chatting among themselves - not really interested; no verbal communication from them - even after our ""hi"" - just a pointed arm in the correct direction after we accidentally turned toward the first class lounge. The lounge itself is light and spacious. Enough choices of food and some fresh fruit. Surprisingly no decaf coffee - not an uncommon demand these days. Upon leaving we again had no acknowledgement - the ladies did not even glance at us as they chatted. A simple smile with a ""hello and welcome"" and an ""enjoy your flight"" as we left would have sufficed. It left us wondering if the rest of our flight was going to be like this - thankfully it wasn't.

Though there was some confusion over guest access for a member which is plus one for *G everywhere, at least that I'm aware of. They were happy to let the card holder in but had to consult the rule book for a companion. This took a while but all was OK in the end. Perhaps it was because Swiss was new to this airport, but then they have had other Star Alliance carriers for a time now. The lounge itself is a decent size but it's on the basis side when it comes to food and beverages. The white wine was especially poor. But lots of nice leather lounges to sit on, free and fast Wi-Fi, active TV news monitors, windows albeit to the landside of the terminal and a business centre with desktop computers and a printer.

I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swiss logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swiss evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swiss lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic.

Each zone allowed you to be private and work and the TVs were at a low volume so as not to disturb. The internet was a little slow and depending on where you sat would lose connectivity.

First - it is ugly no life and for the next year no natural light due to airport construction. The seats are large but arranged in a train format - 2 by 2 and then 8 rows back. If you want to see the TV - almost impossible beyond row 3. Today - the seats were filthy - dry food on the first three seats that I sat on. The food is meagre and uninteresting. Some sushi - but overly cold and poor quality. Sandwiches are clearly made only once a day in the morning. Desserts not bad. The worst part is the staff - unpleasant and unresponsive at best. When I asked for the TV channels to be changed the front desk staff said that it would take 20 minutes - because that they needed a supervisor to do it. When I then asked one of the food clearing staff she changed the channels immediately. The staff at the desk tals so loudly that twice I had to ask them to quiet down so I could conduct a phone call on my mobile.","SWISS INT'L AIR LINES FIRST CLASS /STAR ALLIANCE GOLD LOUNGE REVIEW","Los Angeles Lax Airport","First Class","","","2.0","2","2","3.0","1.0","4.0","4.0","1.0","0"

Its buffet had a coffee machine plus petit-fours and cakes wines and other drinks. I asked the receptionist about the First Class lounge she said it was a 5 minutes walk to Terminal 1.

It has a shower (what a blessing!) and if you use it they will give you a nice selection of L'Occitane toiletries. The Wi-Fi works well. Sometimes a musician plays the piano.

Today the use a lounge on pier E opposite gate 31 which is run by Alitalia staff. To enter you need to use the lift and go down a floor. This means the lounge has no windows. On entering there were 3 receptionists. Non of them were interested in serving me they were too busy on their mobiles. I stood like an idiot for 3 minutes for one of them to say hello. The lounge is not a nice haven. It has old large photo's on the back wall of Rome. It has a bar area toilets and that is just about it. There were no newspapers or magazines. The bar was stocked with basic drinks and beer on tap. The food was terrible curled up sandwiches where you had to search out the filling. The bar attendant was always in the back talking to someone else. I stood for 10 minutes waiting for him to come back to the bar. You could hear him but not see him. The WiFi cost 10 euros per hour which I did not use. There was simply no saving graces to this lounge. This has to be the worst lounge I have EVER used but given the fact that it is run by Alitalia is it any surprise it is so bad.

I had to go back to the Schengen terminal pass the passport control and security check. In the Schengen terminal no signs navigating to the Business Lounge. When I finally managed to find it it was about the time to go back to non-Schengen terminal again through the passport control. The only advantage was that I spent 40 minutes walking which was healthy exercise between 2 flights.

In this instance the lounge was grossly overcrowded with many airlines passengers. There were literally no seats available when I entered and I am writing this review standing up hoping for a seat. The beverage selection was average and the food selection well below average. The staff tried to help and were cheerful but were facing a much bigger crowd than the lounge was designed to handle or than the number of personnel could handle. Because of the big crowd the lounge bathrooms were rarely available and the general cleanliness was not good.

As usual the staff are plentiful friendly and efficient. I have only two negative points about this lounge. The first is the design fault which allows all the noise of the concourse into the lounge as the plate glass windows have large areas open to the main terminal area. This is particularly noticeable in the private sitting rooms. The second also relates to those sitting rooms. Although comfortable they have one draw back. It is very difficult to get the attention of staff without getting up and going to the corridor which runs along the front of the row of sitting rooms. Staff are always passing by but never glance into the rooms. This problem could be easily solved by adding a call button which switched a light outside the room.

The seats are fine and the lounge is quiet. No showers or even toilets available you'll have to use the public toilets outside the lounge.

I find TG's poor quality food inexplicable given Thailand's deserved reputation for affordable tasty cuisine. There are too few toilets many of which are out-of-service; self-service bar options have been removed with liquor placed in a service bar at the extreme end (outside the main seating area) of a 200 meter lounge; and the internet is often unavailable or so slow that Outlook hangs.

Three years on and they still offer precisely the same collection of dreary sandwiches and pastries. The Internet Room appeared to be a play area for children when I visited. There's a reasonable drinks choice but not as good as the old lounges in Don Muang - they now have a small Duty Free Shop which is a useful provision. Perhaps they could channel some of the profit from that into fixing the problems in the lounge.

Staff are abundant friendly and attentive. Free WiFi access is available and it's adequate but quite slow. One gripe that so many of us have is the lack of power easily accessible power outlets for our laptops. The Thai lounge at Suvarnabhumi is fairly new and it's a shame that the designers didn't do what most modern airports are doing (such as NRT) and provide easily accessible outlets for every seat. One major bonus is the offer of a 20 minute massage in the adjacent First Class spa with options for either a foot massage or a head and neck massage. Perfect for relaxing just prior to boarding. My biggest complain would be the catering which is limited to dry snacks small cheap white bread sandwiches instant noodle and various small but rather oily warm pies. The Thai lounge really pales in comparison to their competition in this area. It's also interesting to me that the food catering is actually much better in Thai lounges at other airports Hong Kong for example where various hot dishes are provided and even ice cream. Even the dingy overcrowded Thai lounge at MNL offers a better food catering service. One would think that Thai's flagship home base lounges would provide the best catering but this is not the case.","THAI AIRWAYS ROYAL SILK BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW","Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport","Business Class","","","4.0","4","5","4.0","2.0","4.0","3.0","5.0","0"

I didn't use the showers nor many of the other amenities but the one's I tried to take advantage of didn't instil confidence. I wasn't impressed with the lounge: I thought they might be having an ""off"" day so I asked to speak to someone in charge. It took nearly a half an hour to find someone. the excuse for not having an available manager in the lounge was that it wasn't a busy time of the day despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon on a Friday and packed. It was far too busy and loud. If indeed the mornings are busier I would hate to see it. After sorting through the piles of newspapers that seemed to be tossed haphazardly on the tables - they don't use magazine racks - I found that there were no English newspapers in the lounge. According to the lounge manager they ""have them but they typically run out in the morning"". Knowing that the idea of having some more for the afternoon passengers hadn't occurred to her. Food quality seemed good but accessing catering was very chaotic. For example there are two chefs working in tandem; rather than create a staggered system where some food is constantly coming out of the oven the two of them prepare food together load the ovens together then stand around until they take everything out then start the process again. Of course by the time each batch is ready there is a hoard of people are lined up and instantly they run out until another batch is made. Lockers were an excellent touch and the library was nice though I think that it's more for show than actual use in that it is as exposed and equally noisy as everywhere else in the lounge. A lot of people seemed to be highly irritated with the service on the day I was there and although each one of us seemed to be complaining about smallish problems I got the overall sense that things were simply not up to standard.","TURKISH AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Istanbul Ataturk Airport","Business Class","","","3.0","2","5","3.0","4.0","3.0","0.0","2.0","0"

We wanted coffee and just to relax but there was no place to sit we wandered around for almost 20 minutes before finally grabbing an open seat. All the lockers were also full so nowhere to stash our carryon bags we had to lug them around the lounge too. And to make matters worse the showers were all full for an entire hour. We felt like we were at the Grand Bazaar pushing and shoving our way just to find a seat and a cup of coffee.

I see some other reviewers here raving about the new Business Class lounge - either that is truly different to the First Class lounge or some of them need to visit airline lounges around Asia to find out what good quality is all about.

Buried in the basement of the International Terminal the United Club in Melbourne is embarrassing on a whole new level. From the sad offerings of ""hot"" food to the rarely- looked-after beverage station this lounge disappoints. The walls a soft padded dingy grey relic from the early '90s only serve to bring the mood of the lounge down to a level of murky depression. The worst part of this lounge however is the pathetic ""WiFi service"" that is only provided by Melbourne Airport. Free WiFi from the airport is never good and in the bowels of Tullamarine's transport hub it degrades to ""nearly unusable."" All of this would be fine if not for the lack of chairs. For an international lounge that serves many major continents there are between 25 and 30 seats in the entire lounge. Most of the seats face another so it is more uncomfortable to take an empty seat thereby reducing the most often usable seats by half. Dishes running out food running out and messes left unattended are par for the course at the United Club in MEL. This is by far the worst United Club I have ever been to and Ive been to ORD C LAX T3 Newark and some of the other dregs of the Lounge world.

DSM is a relatively large airport but United flies only a small plane (39 seater) there from EWR once a day and they have no business class lounge facility at DSM! And they are not ashamed of it.

This year I will not renew my lounge membership. Even post-merger the lounges are not well maintained people working the desk in larger airports are not consistently friendly or engaging and with the charging of alcohol that use to be included in membership (don't call it complimentary) it is just not worth it. A few weeks ago I flew Global-First to Sydney and was looking forward to the “First Class” lounge. Reception personnel more interested in chatting amongst themselves and no one in the actual club area to help. The food in this SFO “exclusive” first class lounge had the opportunity to be exceptional but most of the serving dishes were empty.

Wi fi is the worst ever in a lounge I have seen. But the worst part of this lounge and I use the word sparingly is the awful food selection. Crackers shortbread cookies trail mix potato chips etc. Pretty poor selection. Now if I were a drinker which I am not I would be happy here. In the two hours I spent at the lounge at NRT the guy across from me had 4 glasses of red wine and at least 3 beers and countless trips to the grab the trail mix by the boatload.

Upon reaching the bottom of the escalator to the reception desk you could find a rather cold grey holding room with straight back chairs (none in leather) and utilitarian lighting. It looked like cheap IKEA furniture and fixtures filled the room. The most depressing lounge I have ever entered in the world and it just goes to show United never cared about it's elite customers and destroyed Continental's customer perks and more comfortable lounges. It was obvious to me every last penny was pinched at the frequent flier's expense. I left after a while to try the other lounge at B8 area and it was the same depressing room I experienced at the other end. Both expresso/cappuccino machines were broken and the bartenders had to be called from behind the wall to get a drink.

There are some complimentary drinks on offer but through the miserable bar staff who are visibly annoyed that you are not buying a premium drink. They are also served in small glasses and the quality of the wine is appalling. The physical environment in the lounge is not too bad so these seems simple problems to rectify.","UNITED AIRLINES RED CARPET CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW","Chicago O'Hare Airport","Business Class","","","2.0","2","3","1.0","1.0","2.0","4.0","1.0","0"

In Edinburgh twice they said ""no"" then looked at a card document and realised it was ""yes"" but this apparently changes in September and the SQ card is no longer welcome there.

This was 10 am - a bit problematic considering that I would be half way across the Atlantic at the time. So my wife and I had no free spa treatment. There was one lady getting her nails done but the problem was that there were no staff around - probably did not want to pay them overtime on Easter Saturday. To cap it all I went to the loo and there was a disgusting smell of smoke as somebody had been in there smoking. Considering we were offered the exclusive privilege of being in there for the princely sum of £50 each I just did not rate it at all. Very disappointing indeed - stay clear unless it's free!","VIRGIN ATLANTIC CLUBHOUSE LOUNGE REVIEW","London Gatwick Airport","","","","2.0","4","3","2.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","3.0","0"

After this you can play pool or retire in the library while the kids can play in the softplay.

I visited on New Years Eve when there was not much traffic in the lounge which is probably the only nice thing worth mentioning. The catering was appalling and range of drinks very limited since several machines were out of order. There were no newspapers and the very few magazines in the lounge were a few months old. I am sure this place was decent in the 1970's but it has not seen much upgrade ever since. Since I find United to be the worst US airline by far this lounge did nothing to change my point of view. On a final note if you are considering paying 50 USD to enter the lounge (ie. if you do not hold credentials to give you free access) I would seriously recommend you to stay way from this stale and tame lounge.","UNITED AIRLINES RED CARPET BUSINESS CLASS / STAR ALLIANCE LOUNGE REVIEW","San Francisco Airport","Business Class","","","1.0","1","2","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","0"

Soup and a few sandwiches available they seem to run out of these at regular intervals but rather than just getting more made appear to fill them once an hour. The problem is that if there is a sudden influx the sandwiches soon disappear but you may have to wait 45 minutes for them to bring in any more. Drinks not too bad spirits and beer ok a couple each of reds and whites more in fridges if you scratch around. Soft drinks are from large two litre bottles can be a bit flat - coffee and tea available with a dish of cookies. All on self service. If you are a bit hungry then you may do well to eat before security and then use the lounge for a relax and drink.

I told him I had been turned away he helpfully called down got into a discussion about the business class eligibility and sent me down. No cocktails - there's a bar but it's unstaffed and the only drinks are a few diet cokes and some bloody mary mix. A few apples and bags of chips complete the offering. Most unhelpfully since I'm not a Red Carpet Club member I had to buy my own wifi access on t-mobile.
