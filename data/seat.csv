The seat diagram online showed a bulkhead wall in front of the seats but in reality there was no wall and the business seats had a tiny curtain from the top of the seats. We knew the arm rests wouldn't go up but we assumed there would be a wall of some type. So when the business seats reclined we had very limited leg room. The middle seat had no pocket because the view was straight down the whole business class section between the seats. We would have been better off in a regular seat which at least has arm rests that go up. I complained to Air Canada and all they offered was a 15% coupon for a future flight but with major restrictions. The reply from customer relations even stated that a discounted fare would be cheaper than applying the coupon to the full fare.

"air-canada","/seat-reviews/air-canada","Air Canada customer review","W Atkinson","Canada","2014-11-19","My spouse and I were flying to/from LHR via YUL; our outbound trip was at the end of July and home trip in early September. These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The IFES and table tray are located in the armrests as is the remote control for the IFES and overhead lights etc. We found the trays easy to deploy but it took both arms and a lot of effort to get the IFES unit out of the armrest. When deployed it was difficult to view as it was somewhat offset by the armrest or the tray (if deployed). The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily - annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket. The seats are close to washrooms. When cabin crew were accessing the bulkhead storage there was a tendency to hit my feet with the door. Also this is a service area for c rew so it can be noisy as can be the sounds of passengers walking to and from the washrooms. Overhead storage is plentiful. Meals were excellent as was the crew service. For overseas flights it is worthwhile paying extra for the comfort. If we had to do this again we would probably choose seats farther back in this 24-seat cabin to avoid the bulkhead closet crew activity and washroom sounds.","BOEING 777-300","2x4x2","","Economy","","8.0","5","4","4","5","2.0","","","1"

Although we were flying Premium Economy from YWG-YUL-LHR and return there were no PE seats on this aircraft. As a concession AC assigns PE passengers to ""preferred seats"" so in our case this was 12D and 12E which is immediately behind Business Class on this 120-seat aircraft. Boarding this flight was a zoo with many passengers dragging huge carry on luggage and scrambling to find space. As we were in a bulkhead row there is no under seat storage so we also had to scramble to stow our carry ons (just a few small bags by the way). Curiously as the IFES is tied to the seats in front of you that meant there were only two screens for three Economy passengers. The seats have 35"" pitch as opposed to 31-33"" in non -preferred seats.

Air Canada as a concession to passengers flying in aircraft without PE seating assigned us to ""preferred seats"" which in this case was 12A and 12C which were immediately behind the business class section of the cabin. Boarding was reasonably efficient but hampered by the rush of passengers scrambling to find storage for their massive carry ons. As we had no under seat storage we also had to scramble to ensure our few small carry ons were stowed. Our IFES and almost everyone else's on the port side of the aircraft did not work; AC did give us vouchers which when filed on line gave us a 5% discount on future bookings until spring 2015.

I don't think the extra room in Premium Economy is worth the extra money - just a couple of extra inches of pitch, although the seat is wider. Seats recline. I would not fly across the Atlantic in a regular economy seat however. The pitch is very tight. Padding was sufficient - I slept on both outbound and inbound flights. Overhead storage was adequate.

The seats on Rouge are called ""New Slimline Seats"" and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across. There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours. 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some.

The seats are well designed, the headrests are covered with leather, there is an individual pillow (which is aesthetically pleasant) for each seat and the legroom is quite good (I'm tall). But the most impressive thing is the HD screen! In Economy Class, having a such beautiful screen is uncommon. The seat recline is not the best I have known but that's correct. I really appreciated the service and I love the new brand image, built on the French values (the safety video is adorable). I do recommend this airline for a long-haul flight!","Boeing 777-300","3x4x3","","Economy","Solo Leisure","10.0","5","4","5","5","5.0","","","1"

If you feel like you're not lucky to be in this small cabin (the upper deck one is the only one on the plane) look at the economy passengers behind you!

My perceptions of the level of comfort may be slightly different as I am 5' 1"" and was seated next to a small child however my husband (5' 11"") also found the seating as comfortable as on economy class on any other scheduled European airline. This row is immediately behind the one behind a bulkhead (i.e. behind the row often given to families - we were lucky to have a quiet family in front who slept as well as we did). Passengers on those rows generally do not recline their seats so much due to the extra space in front of them consequently we in turn did not feel so trapped in our seats as passengers further back may have done - our seats did not recline as much as some on other aircraft but we did not find this a problem.

This was unfortunately the most uncomfortable seat I sat in on a long haul flight. The seat looks good on the website when first looking at it. Air France makes its Premium Economy a real additional class. There are fewer seats per row. The seat is designed so that you have real isolated private space. You also have quite a lot legroom. Unfortunately the design of the seat itself is an outright disaster. The seat area itself is way too short even for short people. The seat hardly reclines at all. The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be extremely short - shorter than 160 cm like me. However not using the footrest will have your feet dangling in mid air. There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is too short it will hardly support anything. The seat is a disaster or an overnight long haul flight. Air France should feel ashamed charging extra for these seats.

"air-france","/seat-reviews/air-france","Air France customer review","K Roberts","United States","2014-07-24","The seat did not actually recline it sort of slid down and the front edge of the bottom seat cushion moved forward. However it didn't reach a position which was comfortable. The ""footrest"" was terrible it was really a ""legrest"" that only extended about 2/3 the way from my knees to my ankles but all it did was press against my calves and cut off the circulation. It was also difficult to put back had to press hard against it with my legs while pushing a button on the inside arm of the seat. The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach - I'm not particularly large so I don't know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table. I had to have the seat completely in the upright position to be able to use the table at all and it was rather awkward trying to eat with it that close. Also the seat adjustment buttons are right under where the table hinges so it's essentially impossible to adjust the seat when the table is out. We were sitting in the first row on the right side of the plane so had lots of legroom; I give the normal seats 4 of 5 based on my observation but I'm not very tall so don't need a lot of legroom. The video screen was in the other arm of the seat position when out was OK but not great a little low and of course off center.","AIRBUS A380","2x3x2","","Premium Economy","","3.0","4","1","3","3","3.0","","","0"
"air-france","/seat-reviews/air-france","Air France customer review","Max Gordon","Germany","2014-03-11","Adequate width. Hardly any recline. Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount. Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs (activated by button on seat). Base of seat in front has foot rest. However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible- even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close. I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason. I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were ""dangling"". Sleep was possible but only just. Lights from other passenger´ seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep. Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy. The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all. Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested. The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken- the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down - the latching mechanism was defective. This problem could not be sorted out before departure. However I was able to move to the next seat in the row. If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the ""upright"" position. Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard. The seats appeared to be superior to the economy seats as far as the width was concerned. However I do not consider the extra cost to be justified. The price differential compared to what is on offer is far higher than e.g. from economy to business.","BOEING 777-300ER","2x4x2","","Premium Economy","","2.0","2","2","4","2","3.0","","","0"

Seat recline is ok and legroom is good. The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue. Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie (not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily).","BOEING 777-300","3x3x3","","Economy","","2.0","4","2","1","2","1.0","","","0"

Do not believe the video on the AF website and do not believe the hype. The seats are narrow and have been designed so badly that you have no chance of a restful flight. You just slide down and your knees bang into the seat in front. You get plastic cutlery and cups and same food as economy. Do not pay for this class of fare. There is very little difference to their AF economy class. The service is the same non-existent. Makes me ashamed to hold a French passport.

I'm not exactly skinny but neither am I obese yet this seat was so narrow it cut off circulation to my thighs. To make matters worse my shoulders and upper arms kept bumping up against the passenger to my right (I was in an aisle seat) to the point where I finally had to get up and pace around the plane to relieve the discomfort. Throughout the entire trip from Miami to Paris I was lucky if I was able to sleep for 20 minutes.

They are hard. The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height. These problems were compounded by the failure to carry extension belts which fit the short seat-belts fitted on the second and third of the three rows (I was able to use the belt on the A319 on the connecting flight without difficulty). I therefore had to be transferred to the front row. This has a bulkhead which diminishes the value of the extra leg-room when the seat is upright: when I tried to use the (limited) recline  an extension came out which pinned my feet to the bulkhead. In short this cabin is over-priced offering less than the preferred seats in the Air Canada Economy cabin","BOEING 777-200ER","2x4x2","","Premium Economy","","1.0","2","1","1","3","2.0","","","0"

I sat at the front of the premium economy cabin. Pros- more legroom than the standard premium economy seats. Cons the tray tables are in the arms and not as large as the normal seats which makes working on a laptop a little less convenient. Overall I would certainly choose this seat again. I had a day flight both ways so did not try to sleep. Seat was comfortable for the duration and I did not find it too hard. As I was working most of the flight I didn't use the recline much but it seemed OK. The laptop power is standard 240V and either a standard French type or US plug will fit. It is limited in power and my laptop which is fairly low power would only work if the battery was taken out. That said the supply never faltered. Video was good with a reasonable large screen (although nobody could describe it as pin sharp) and a good choice of current films and TV shows. The earphones are OK but I used my own which plugged into a single 3.5mm socket so there was no need for an adapter. Service was OK not bad but not exceptional and the food was standard economy fare OK but nothing to get excited about. Overall a very pleasant flight and I don't think that I would have had much of a better flight in business class (but I wasn't trying to sleep).

While the Premium Economy price is considerably more than the economy we have willingly paid the difference for the comfort experienced on the long haul. Over the years we have experienced a variety of seating arrangements from the noticeable wider seats with more leg room to the ""moon seats"" which proved extremely uncomfortable and ultimately to the 777-200 flight which offered us the worst imaginable flight experience. The seats on our last trip to Queenstown and return were much narrower. We questioned our memory of past flights and finally checked the economy seats. Unfortunately economy seats did not look smaller than the premium economy. Our trip on January 4th this year to Queenstown found us on the long haul flight bumping elbows as we sat. There was no extra room to turn to choose a comfortable spot for sleeping. To use the phrase ""disappointing"" with reference to our latest trip and my own flight to Queenstown last May of 2014 is an understatement. The cost of our travel from Toronto to Queenstown was very close to $10000 for two adults. When advised by two friends who also traveled to Queenstown one week after us that their individual economy fares were in the region of $2500 each I am left wondering why so much was paid for so little. The premium economy accommodation would seem to be excessive in light of the meagre room afforded to your patrons of this class. I would be interested to know why customer care has been cut back and to what end. The crew are wonderful and every attempt is made within the cabin to accommodate travellers.

What I love about the Spaceseat is that you don't have some clown reclining into your personal space forcing your food into your face or spilling your drink. The TV screen is fine just move it to a better position. There is plenty of room even for larger folk. It's so comfortable and the cabin is nice and private. The purple beanbag/footrest is very welcome. Flip your shoes off and settle in. The only thing that could be improved is the recline seating should be electronic buttons rather than manual.

We scored an upgrade (paid) to Business on the way back and although the ability to sleep on an actual bed on an overnight flight was a real plus we found there was a lot less personal space in Business compared to Premium Economy. The downside was having to fly economy-class Auckland to Adelaide (single class plane only). I literally had to get out the seat 3 times during the 4 hour flight as my leg became so numb I was concerned any longer locked in that position would lead to serious health issues. I was unable to point my foot upwards and had to sit locked in a splayed position whilst seated. I can't imagine how I would have coped with a 12 hour flight in that position.","BOEING 777","2x2x2","","Premium Economy","","9.0","5","4","5","5","4.0","","","1"

Do Not believe the sales job on their website. The notion of paying premium price for two adults in three seats to be able to lay down is a joke. This would accommodate one adult at the most. This is being marketed for adults and families to lay down on long-haul flights. It is frustratingly cramped and the expectation set by the marketing makes it worse. The flight attendants have obviously dealt with this before as they started apologizing before we took off from LHR to LAX. We should have known something was wrong as the LHR ground staff wouldn't look us in the eye when we asked about the SkyCouch seating.

While the seats themselves were nice and comfy the one downside is that if you have your seat up and the person in front reclines you have a TV screen inches from your face which made for a incredibly uncomfortable journey. On the return trip we tried the skycouch (2 adults travelling) and there is much improvement depending on what you want to use it for. We reclined the seats back and put it into 'bed' mode. For us this was fine as my girlfriend was happy to sit upright in the isle seat which allowed me to lay across the 3 seats. The extra width was lovely and made for a far more comfortable journey (even for my girlfriend who was now able to put her feet up also. The people in front did not recline giving us more space but the problem would still exist with the screen being close if they had and because of this I think if 2 people were to lay side by side with the seat in front reclined it would make it more like a coffin for one person. Saying that if you want to take turns with laying out then I would highly recommend paying the bit extra for have more sitting/laying options and generally more comfort. We are flying again with ANZ on the same journey and have booked the hard shell space seat to see if this improves the journey. I could not find a fault with the rest of the airline staff entertainment and food were all first class hence why we are flying again.","BOEING 777-300","3x5x3","","Economy","","9.0","3","3","4","3","5.0","","","1"

I have travelled in both an inside and outside seat on the right and left of the two aisles and not the odd-looking away-facing pairs in the centre so my comments apply to the former. You sit at an angle of about 20 degrees to the aisle with the backs of the seat shells in front of you at the normal (right angle) to the aisle. This means that your TV (which can just about compensate for the off-centreness) and your tray table (which can't) are at a weird angle. The window seats have better leg room than the aisle ones but the down side is that getting out - particularly if the 'aisle' person has the TV out on its angled stilts and the tray table open (no rim glassholder or recess- beware!) is a mountaineering job - but at least using the shell in front as a lever will not disturb the occupants Air New zealand are obviously sensitive about it as on both flights the concierge were on the defensive (unsolicited on my last flight) - ""We've taken one row of seats out"" (Heaven knows what it was like before).

There's just no way to get comfortable. For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined.

I am 185 cm and I have broad shoulders and I was very uncomfortable for the transatlantic flight. The width of the isle was so narrow that I was not possible to pull my hand luggage along the floor. You will have to pay for a blanket and headphones on this airline. The in flight entertainment system is ok; full touch screen, but a limited number of movies and shows. The service was good, but it was obvious that the flight attendant was not fluent in French when making her announcements which for a dual language airline is not what you would expect. The attendants were friendly. Food was ok, but there was not enough. Flying this airline again I will make sure that I eat plenty before the flight!

"airasia-x","/seat-reviews/airasia-x","AirAsia X customer review","R West","Australia","2014-01-06","I paid extra for what Air Asia X calls a 'hot seat' with more legroom directly behind the premium economy cabin. The legroom was generous (I am 194 cm and I could stretch out) and the space in front of the seat also made access very easy. However in a crowded plane the lack of shoulder room was very uncomfortable - this airline has nine seats across in its A330 cabin where most airlines have eight. The sense of tightness was exacerbated by the arm-rests on my row of seats having to accommodate tray tables narrowing the available space further. The seats themselves are leather clad and hard; they also lack lower lumbar support. They do have adjustable head rests - a great feature. I've rated the seat overall as a '5' simply because I managed to sleep for about two hours of a seven hour plus sector. I have rated the PTV screen as 1; in fact the on-board entertainment system comes in the form of portable units which can be rented - I didn't try them however.","AIRBUS A330-300","3x3x3","","Economy","","5.0","5","3","1","5","1.0","","","0"

The flight is a ""seasonal"" flight and it appears that they do not use a ""regular"" plane on it. The various seat review sites said that the ""Classica"" Cabin in the two class version had new seats with IFE. Old very old seats with no cushion left in the cushioning and no in-seat back IFE. Rather we had a CRT every 10 rows (and ours was broken). This means that the Seat arms go up all the way and no boxes to block legroom. The bad - well seat back IFE is essentially ""the standard"" now. So I am of two minds. The leg room and fully disappearing arm rests are good. The old cushionless cushions very bad. The lack of seat back IFE that's just unusual and very third world. So if you are taking a night flight the plane is not full and you don't need to be entertained this is likely better than most of the coach across the Atlantic.","AIRBUS A330-200","2x4x2","","Economy","","4.0","4","2","2","1","1.0","","","1"

The seats are on a 30"" pitch - the tightest in the AA fleet and if you are over 5'6"" tall you will be uncomfortable. The only upside is the IFE - every seat has a screen with some content to distract you from the cramped and uncomfortable seats - I would not recommend this aircraft for any flight over 2 hours. To add insult to injury to the frequent flyer there are only 8 first class seats giving a ration of 1 to 14 of first to economy. By comparison the outgoing MD80 had 16 first class seats giving a ratio of 1-8. So the new and improved A319 has a smaller seat pitch than the outgoing MD80 ledd first class seats (half as many) but has a TV screen in each seat.

Height of the IFE screen is just an inch or two lower than the preferred height mainly due to the design restrictions in the seatback. The normal IFE box found under the seats in older aircraft was gone. IFE system was fair in terms of usability and stability but not perfect. The movie selection was quite nice and the pause/play/options appeared in a natural and quick way. Picture quality was also good. They've added a ""World News"" feature in every IFE that allows full internet connectivity to worldwide news sources (free). My biggest complaint about the new IFE system would have to be the seat recline viewing angle. Whilethe seat recline is very good with the new seats I would define it as ""virtually impossible"" to watch the IFE screen in full-recline of the seat in front of you. The seat itself was average.

AA are still flying old 757-200 on this transatlantic route and we experienced appalling service. Everything about this flight now ranks as my worst ever flying experience. The seat pitch is only 31"" (if that) which is sub-standard on such an important international route for a national carrier. The aircraft lacks personal in-flight entertainment. The positioning of the ceiling tv screens means that passengers in seats A and F cannot adequately view any video entertainment let alone the mandatory safety video. The meal quality was embarrassing for AA. The cabin crew were very unprofessional.

Very old and worn plane. Seats very uncomfortable and dated. No individual screens just a select few throughout the cabin. Our seats were changed at the last minute due to operational needs ie. should have been a B777 but was a B767-300 instead. We paid for preferred seats with no one behind us but got stuck with people in front and behind due to change. I would not fly American Airlines again unless I was desperate. The crew were miserable and ready for retirement. We barely saw them too busy at the back of the plane reading and chatting! American Airlines need to get their act together. The outbound flight from LHR-DFW (B777 27A/B) wasn't much better and was treated like a night flight even though it was 9.30am! The 'fasten seatbelt' sign was illuminated the whole ten hours even though there was no turbulence to stop passengers getting out of their seats. Food really poor and tasteless.

So I checked on Sat, 18th and Sunday 19th and on both occasions the only seats that were available were 2+2+1+1+1, so 7 in total. Therefore I felt that I could not wait until Tues, 21st for online check in, as I wanted to ensure that I sat next to my wife. So with that in mind I pre-booked 2 seats 15a and 15b to ensure that we sat together and the extra £50. However, when I checked the seat availability again on Mon, 20th and Tues 21st, I was shocked to see that there were plenty of seats available. When I saw this I felt I had been forced and cheated by BA to pay an extra £50, this left a bitter taste in my mouth and was angry with the way I had been treated by BA.  The flight was delayed for 1 hour 40mins without an explanation as to why. Ok, these things happen but an explanation as to why were were delayed would have been appreciated.  By the time the cabin crew came round with the supposed lunch, it was close to 3pm and by the time the cabin crew reached us, they could not offer us a choice of food and the only thing that was left, was Fish. Therefore we were left with 2 trays of front of us with a salad bowl, a bread roll, an empty cup and an empty glass and a napkin with various cutlery, totally useless if you have no food to eat.  Eventually crew managed to find a Chicken dish that we could eat. The Club Europe cabin was not sectioned off to the economy class passengers. So these passengers were constantly walking past us to use the toilet facilities that were meant for Club Europe passengers.  After several complaints from myself and fellow passengers did they make an announcement over the PA about the facilities.

On this 777-300 we had the ""new"" World Traveler Plus seats. The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were ""slimline"" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it's nice but doesn't add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front.

"british-airways","/seat-reviews/british-airways","British Airways customer review","J Gardner","United States","2014-10-27","We flew SEA-LHR on an aging 747-400 in World Traveler Plus seats 29 J and K near the 3R door. BA boards WT+ dead last. The seats were the old WT+ and showed their age in all respects (worn dirty etc); the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything. The cabin was unbearably warm; be aware that BA's long-haul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents - so no way to keep cool. Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door. Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons (and AVOD controls) on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult. While it's true that the cost of WT+ is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real rest/sleep. On the other hand WT+ is far superior to what US airlines offer as their premium economy product (e.g. Delta ""economy comfort"" on its 767-300 on the same SEA to LHR route).","BOEING 747-400","2x4x2","","Premium Economy","","6.0","4","4","3","5","2.0","","","1"

I had flown from PLS-MIA before that flight to LHR but couldn't get any sleep because of the most uncomfortable chairs.

Usually the extra cost is about £500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a £500 premium in the seat £300 tops. (I have just had a look at the BA web site and the same return flights as mine for next week has an £1800 premium utter madness)","AIRBUS A380","3x3x3","","Premium Economy","","4.0","3","2","2","3","4.0","","","0"

The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen.

Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening.

First 10 hours to HK were okay pretty on par with other major airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration. However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I've sat on. The fact that the seat doesn't recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort. I'm average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people. When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders. As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap. There's also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it's probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there's also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you can't fit much under the seat either. The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration. I was travelling with just one other person and it was nice to just sit in a twosome without fear of the dreaded middle seat or clambering over a stranger while they sleep to go to the restroom.","AIRBUS A340","2x4x2","","Economy","","2.0","1","1","1","1","1.0","","","0"

The seat has good pitch very good width and storage with the cubbin on the seatback plus three pouches below the literature pocket- all very useful for a long flight. The AVOD system is great but only needs more and better choices of programs and games. Two major problems with these new seats - the base seat cushion becomes hard quickly and the recline intrudes greatly on personal space and privacy. At two hours (on a 15 hour flight) the seat became noticeably uncomfortable. My legs became numb from pinched circulation at about 3 hours. The new 6 inches recline is nice when you are sitting in it but intrudes greatly into the space behind you. The unpredictability of a 2 to 6 inch recline creates stress. Your knees get banged laptop knocked off the tray table etc. And your personal space and privacy is mostly in control of the whim of the passenger in front of you. Also the thinner and lighter seat material makes for a smaller seat footprint which amplifies the loss of privacy when the person in front or to your side reclines. When the adjacent seat reclines if you are to the right you get an almost full view of their TV screen. That can be a distraction to you as their screen flashes when you want to read or sleep.","BOEING B777-300","3x3x3","","Economy","","5.0","4","4","3","2","5.0","","","0"

In the recline position however you get pretty much no back support as you end up sliding down (below the head rest) to get into any type of position conducive to sleep. For flights under 5 hours I would choose these seats over standard reclining seats. You have good view of the screen there's a power outlet and you can enjoy the inflight entertainment. Where Cathay made the mistake is for long haul flights where people are inclined to sleep for some portion of the flight. For sleep these are absolutely the worst seats. I think they made a mistake in installing them on their trans-continental flights. In an ironic note if you don't want to sleep on your flight these seats are the best. If you want to sleep choose a different airline.

This put my back into a painful slumped position and because the seat back was still upright my head and neck were pushed forward. Within half an hour I had excruciating back pain which I couldn't get rid of regardless of how I positioned myself.

This makes it very hard to sleep because your head keeps flopping forward. The other issue with the recline on these seats is that the seat base slides forward making it very hard to extend your legs out under the seat in-front of you.

These seats are unquestionably the worst we have ever experienced I am just glad we left our 6' plus son behind. We assumed this was an old plane/old design; having just visited the Cathay site I am shocked to learn they are being lauded particularly given all the negative reviews.","A330","2x4x2","","Economy","","1.0","3","1","3","3","3.0","","","0"

When eventually the meal reached Row 76 it was luke warm. The drinks trolley arrived as we were finishing the meal and tea and coffee was not offered. Landing at DXB was delayed for over one hour by a duststorm that we understood had been raging for several days. We boarded the B777 for DXB-DAR on time only to sit on the stand for some two hours whilst other flights were given greater priority to take off in the limited visibility caused by the duststorm. To be fair the flight and service on this leg was quite reasonable once airborne. However we arrived at DAR so late that we had missed our onward flight to ZNZ and had to pay for a replacement and to add to the stress Emirates had opted to leave one of our bags either at LHR or DXB. The return from DAR-DBX was good but the having boarded the A380 at DBX very efficiently the departure from the stand on the DXB-LHR was delayed for an hour due to a medical emergency (obviously not Emirates fault). Once airborne it was again evident that the cabin crew simply cannot cope with the number of passengers a fully loaded A380 and once again service did not match expectations. From past experience Emirates has always warranted its 4 star rating but standards have clearly slipped in recent time and that is no longer the case.

We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service.

The reviews you will read about the 2x4x2 section at the very rear of the aircraft are true. 46K had more legroom space between the seat and the window and an overall feeling of a bit more privacy. The cons to 46K are that the armrest between 46J and K is a permanent one that cannot be raised or lowered. This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 5'8"" and average size. Another con to being at the very back of the plane is that it takes a long time to deplane and they were out of the meal I wanted by the time they got to me. 28A was just fine but only because there was no one in the middle seat next to me. Originally there was and after the doors we closed the FA came and found him an aisle seat to move to. Before he moved however I was already sore from leaning against the window just so our shoulders wouldn't touch. Had he stayed there the entire 13.5 hr flight that would have been terrible. The 3x4x3 layout overall is a bad idea for passenger comfort. Not only are the seats shoulder- touchingly narrow but the other comments you've read about the aisle width are very true. I had to sidestep down the aisles to try and avoid bumping other passengers. And at meal/drink service time? Forget it. I did not have a problem with the lack of a footrest as some have commented. Sure it would have been nice to have but my feet touched the floor just fine and I'm 5'8"". If this is a problem for you I'd suggest using your carry on or as I read in a different forum bring a beach ball with you. When not inflated it takes up almost no room it costs $1 and if you partially inflate it it won't roll and makes a good makeshift footrest.","BOEING 777-300ER","3x4x3","","Economy","","7.0","5","3","2","3","4.0","","","1"

It was without a doubt the worst flight I've ever flown as far as comfort. The flight was about 6 hours long. I thought Emirates was a top class airline. I was disappointed that they preferred to pack people in rather than aim for the comfort of its passengers. I requested an aisle seat and even the trolleys could hardly manage to make it through the aisles. Everyone had to walk sideways. I was hit and jostled constantly by people coming through (they could not help it). I am 1m73 and felt the seat already on my knees. When the person reclined it was even more uncomfortable. I spent most of the flight standing up rather than sitting in that uncomfortable seat. To make matters worse there was the video for the row in front of me on the floor where I should have been able to put my feet (the row in front was the exit row) so I could not even fully extend my legs! This was the first time and I hope the last time to fly Emirates.","Boeing 777","3x4x3","","Economy","","2.0","1","3","3","4","4.0","","","0"

When the compartment couldn't close the stewardess said that I would have to find another place to put them. My wife and I eventually found space 3 rows behind our seats. Sitting on the isle allowed me to be bumped in the shoulder by staff regularly throughout the trip. No acknowledgement or apologies received typified the standard of the service. We couldn't understand how the airline was 'award winning' based on experiencing both trips. I was able to get a laugh from the Etihad Airline's approach to censoring movies.

As a result you either have to sit diagonally with both legs on the left side or do the splits with a leg on each side but the problem with this is that the left leg's calf muscle will have the corner of the foot rest jar up into the muscle causing pain after some time. Also when fully reclined it is difficult to get your feet under the seat in front of you.

We were sat on the left hand side right over the engines (seats 24 A & B) which was very noisy and bumpy. The seats are some of the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in for an 8 hour flight with a leg rest that leaves your feet dangling and cuts into the calfs of your legs. When the seat in front was reclined I had 2 inches between my knees and the back of that seat. Because of the boxes around the chair anchor points I was made completely immobile with nowhere to put my feet and had to sit in a skewed position with both legs bent to the right. The food wasn't too good either. I ended the flight feeling very stiff and sore.

My daughter joked that the pillows were just Marimekko pillow slips they were flat and did little to offer any support If you choose Finnair be sure to take a travel pillow and ask for several pillows and blankets to try and prop your arms and provide lumbar support. I'm a pretty fit person and got up several times to stretch but I did myself nerve damage from being so cramped I worry how it would affect less robust people. I asked for a glass of water twice from stewards and was ignored my daughter asked not to be woken for meals after the first time she was woken for a meal and the stewards awoke her again. The chocolate wafers they had in the galley were I hung out helping myself to waters were pretty nice though.","AIRBUS A340","2x4x2","","Economy","","3.0","3","3","3","3","4.0","","","0"

I was in seat 2A on 16th June BKK-MEL. Don't think that you will get comfort or attention in this seat class. Row 1 seats recline to the point where they trap passengers in Row 2 with minimal space between rows and making is completely impossible to leave your seat during the flight. There is little equality in this booking class - Row 1 seems reasonable whereas Rows 2 and 3 seem like cages. A colleague in Row 3 experienced similar problems as I did: her seat reclined only part way and when the seat in front was fully reclines, she was unable to escape the fact that the seatback was so close to her face that eating a meal became an exercise in contortion. This seat configuration is a by-product of Jetstar squeezing in those extra seat rows to maximise their profit. This comes at the expense of the passengers' comfort and meant that my flight was spent longing for the Economy experience on carriers like Cathay Pacific with whom I have flown to S E Asia many times.","Boeing 787","2-3-2","20-06-2015","Premium Economy","Business","1.0","1","1","2","1","1.0","","1.0","0"

"klm-royal-dutch-airlines","/seat-reviews/klm-royal-dutch-airlines","KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review","Allan Garden","United States","2015-07-28","Been flying with KLM for over 25 years now in various classes but last experience in economy from Houston to Amsterdam was the worst flight I've ever experienced. I am about to end my long term relationship with KLM after this. I am 1.95m tall and not so thin, and was sitting with my wife and son in row 33 (all 3 seats), I was in the aisle seat. It was physically impossible for me to sit with my legs straight out in front of me there simply wasn't enough room to fit my bones between the seats, so I had to splay my legs outwards. On the outward aisle side my leg couldn't fit under the arm rest (which is fixed and can't move up) so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time. On the inside my leg was now in my son's seat space and my feet couldn't get under the seat due to the box on the floor. My son is also over 1.90m so he was already experiencing similar issues, without me using his leg room. All this was without the person in front reclining their seat.  We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space, but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits. Third issue: just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder, pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person, nothing more. Fourth issue: if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out. Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. Bottom line: this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM, or any airline come to that. This has never happened to me before outside of one other (also with KLM) experience on a short haul flight (~2 hours), but for an intercontinental flight of ~10 hours this is terrible. Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort, but it should never result in physical pain to anyone, or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space. In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse, but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France. KLM's relationship with it's passenger's has deteriorated to one of simply money - everyone buys a basic seat, but if you're tall or not thin then we (KLM) know you'll probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat. There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers, or meeting their needs, so long as we make a few bucks out of you, we're happy even though we know you're not. Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better. KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game, but if that's the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions.  It might surprise you to learn that if I'm going to have to pay a bit more to get a better seat then I'd be prepared to pay it up front to guarantee seat quality and comfort! That attitude builds customer loyalty and satisfaction, not fear, discomfort and pain!","Boeing 747","3x4x3","28-07-2015","Economy","FamilyLeisure","1.0","1","1","1","1","1.0","","1.0","0"

My extendable head rest would not stay in an extended position and my seat would not recline. My screen was also awful and unwatchable. When I asked to be reseated they told me no other seats were available despite the plane being 80% full and them trying to sell the premium economy seats before takeoff. After a 3 hr struggle to fall asleep my knee was hit by the steward and his cart waking me up and hurting my knee no apology or even acknowledgement was given.

GRU-MUN flight of June 5 on Lufthansa's A340-600 was ok. My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that didn't do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats. I practically got no sleep at all, just like some passengers who'd rather stand up during the whole flight than being squeezed on a seat. Food was nice and so was the crew, but I vow never to flight coach on Lufhansa again.","Boeing 747-8","3x4x3","14-06-2015","Economy","Business","2.0","1","1","1","1","3.0","","4.0","0"

But this time I was excited to try the brand new 747-8 thinking it would be more spacious and comfortable than the old 400s. My mistake. The truth is they shrank the space in the coach class and created a more spacious Business and First Class. More than half of the 747's main deck is dedicated to First and Business while 262 coach passengers are squeezed on the rear. I am 1.80m tall and it was very difficult to me to find a nice position to rest and relax. Absolutely no sleeping during the 11 hours flight! To make it even worse the flight was completely full. The good things? The staff was nice and friendly the food was good and there was plenty of drinks you don't use to find in someone's else coach class. On the first flight's leg (CDG-FRA) I travelled on a LH A321 which was much more comfortable and spacious than the long haul 747. This is happening not only on Lufthansa but in several other airlines I have flown lately like United Airlines TAM Airlines Delta etc. Lufthansa again?

I was in seat 27G which is the second row of Economy seats now the reason for the extra legroom is the fact that the plane layout goes from a 2x3x2 to a 2x4x2 in row 27. Seat G is basically halfway in the aisle. however the rest of the row is god awful because the seats aren't perfectly aligned and therefore every seat has immovable armrests for tray tables but the video screens are still on the seat in front giving a very crooked view. Honestly it is the most aggravating thing. Another huge reason for the low score is the bathrooms. Lufthansa has a neat little feature where they place all economy bathrooms downstairs on the bottom deck. This is really cool however there are only 5 of them. The flight attendants also have to guard the stairs to make sure that crowding doesn't occur. They vigilantly stand guard and make sure a line of no more than 5 people forms (which happens rather quickly). Almost impossible to use the restroom.","AIRBUS A340-600","2x4x2","","Economy","","2.0","4","2","2","1","2.0","","","0"

The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets. Wifi is available at a small price; but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop. Unless you're very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers - but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which isn't always possible. This negates the advantage of having Wifi available. The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes. You can normally find 4-5 hours of viewing from the selection. The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental. If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi.

This means that it is the only window seat that is also an aisle seat. However the tray table is the bulkhead variety and is flimsy. The table slopes towards the left hand side when loaded. This is a problem when eating during turbulence as any liquid will almost certainly slide off the tray - this happened to me! The seat area is very draughty and cold - maybe just the bad flight I was on. The distance between the seat and the window is large meaning several pillows are required to bridge the gap (and support your head). I do not recommend paying extra for this seat unless you are over 6 foot tall and will benefit from the leg room. Might also be a good option for young families - kids can come and go without disrupting parents in 74B/C.","AIRBUS A380","3x4x3","","Economy","","4.0","5","5","4","5","2.0","","","0"

When they introduced Premium Economy with the launch of the new A380, this was a fantastic new flying class in my opinion.  The amenities have been down-graded since then, but over all, I have found the staff on all my flights to be excellent.  I agree that the cost for PE has increased over the years, but if you keep your eye out for flight deals from Qantas and their partners, then the higher price compared to normal economy is not double.  Also if you have the option to book 2-3 months in advance of your travel date, then you also get the chance to select great seats (ie: Exit row, 24J).

The seats are most impressive I felt extremely comfortable in these seats and there was no sense that I was encroaching in my neighbors space. Legroom above average with plenty of space between myself and the seat in front of me - even when the seat in front was fully reclined. Seat pitch is far above the limited seat pitch in a conventional economy cabin. Tray tables are stowed in the left armrest and is fully flexible and adjustable to suit the 'shape' of the passenger and the meal service. PTV is stowed in the right armrest and can be used comfortably in conjunction with the tray table. IFE system is fast and responsive and had a good selection of shows and latest releases. A word of caution however is to check the aircraft operating your flight as the PTVs and IFE system was older on my return leg to JNB. Fewer options a more outdated UI and a disappointing experience. Almost all movies had Chinese and/or English subtitles - which for me was a deal breaker and resulted in me rather reading a book. This is a personal preference however but I would of appreciated an option to remove this!

My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well. If I had the choice I would chose the Emirates A380 over Quantas' A380 on a long flight purely due to the much more comfortable seat better IFE and great goodies for kiddies. Thus outweighs (for us) our experience that Qantas have more friendly and attentive cabin crew. If we were to fly on the Qantas A380 it would be in the same seats or upstairs (review of our return trip to come).","AIRBUS A380","3x4x3","","Economy","","5.0","3","4","4","4","3.0","","","1"

"qantas-airways","/seat-reviews/qantas-airways","Qantas Airways customer review","A Dey","Australia","2013-02-15","LAX to Sydney. The economy A380 seats are a disgrace. The backs are thinner making every movement and touch from behind felt immediately. The seats recline beautifully - except the lovely recline means you are lying in someone's lap and someone is probably lying in your lap. This makes sitting up and reading impossible if the person in front of you goes to sleep before you do. The entertainment screen is also too close to see clearly as soon the seat in front of you is reclined. Lucky for me the gentleman in front of me was asked to raise his seat back so I could eat. The seats themselves are barely wide enough to sit in. There is less leg room than any other flight I've been on in my life. To eat requires the capacity to keep one's arms glued to one's sides while wielding a fork and knife so one is not elbow jousting with the neighbor. The tray table is so small it barely fits the tiny food tray which is all of about 9 x 5 inches. The entertainment screen remote is tucked away in the arm between the seats so you have to ask the person next to you to move his arm to retrieve it. Then you have to slam the armrest lid down on the attached cord without breaking it. I just kept the remote out and hanging off the edge of my seat so I didn't have to bother that poor guy again. The armrests also do not raise all the way so if you are fortunate enough to have an empty seat next to you you can't get rid of it and stretch out a bit more or rest your head against the next seat.I weigh 100 lbs/about 47 kg. I am thin and not tall. This seat was uncomfortable for me. Now imagine what it is like for any normal human.

While the seat was as comfortable as the A380 I made the mistake of selecting the bulkhead. It is great as know one is in front of you but there is no cut out for your feet. I know understand why people put their feet on the bulkhead. I wished I'd chosen a standard seat in the end! It's not cramped and if you're upright its fine but if you recline and want to stretch your legs you can't . Trade off I guess between that and no one in front of you.

"qantas-airways","/seat-reviews/qantas-airways","Qantas Airways customer review","M Eggleton","United Kingdom","2013-01-03","This review is for economy seat 48A which is an exit seat if it were a normal seat it would be much lower score (London-Singapore-Melbourne). I think this is one of the best seats to get in economy. You are the last to board and the first to get off. The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where. It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 6'0 you can't really stretch your leg out fully. I'm 6'4 and didn't have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either.. and the best thing is this seat only cost $25 to book compared to the $160-180 they charge for the other extra leg room seats/exit seats (including the two next to you). People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride. If flying on an A380 with 31"" or less leg room like Qantas you'll want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TV's quite ridiculous. The seats recline too much. I think a better foot rest would be better than 2"" extra recline.","A380","3x4x3","","Economy","","8.0","5","5","4","3","5.0","","","1"

Only downside is you share loos with Economy. Noise cancelling headphones are good but the AVOD system is looking dated - A380 is much better. Foot rest is useless for taller people - they would be better off having an additional bar to flip out under the seat in front. Seat width is more than adequate for me being a narrow girth. It isn't business class - you have to pay alot more for that - but you do get treated more individually than in economy - and Premium Economy being a small cabin it feels more individual - Qantas get a big thumbs up from me for the overall experience.","BOEING 747-400","2x4x2","","Premium Economy","","8.0","5","5","5","4","3.0","","","1"

The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control.

"qantas-airways","/seat-reviews/qantas-airways","Qantas Airways customer review","Mark Keohane","United Kingdom","2009-10-14","Premium Economy LHR-SYD-LHR A380. I had my eye on 38J and K (exit row rear right of the cabin) and managed to get them there and back. This gave us (me + wife) masses of legroom so that wasn't an issue. Recline is OK and we managed a decent amount of sleep though it still felt like airline sleep rather than truly restful sleep. Food was ordinary in truth though nicely served on linen china etc. Staff were excellent on three of the four legs. We were addressed by name on several occasions by smiling crew. On SYD-SIN leg the Customer Services Manager walked around and met everyone in the cabin shook hands and thanked us for flying with Qantas -then repeated this as we approached SIN! Premium Economy cabin is quite close to the tail so lateral movement is quite noticeable during turbulence. IFE is first-class; touch- screen intuitive interface and loads of choice. First time I've taken more than a passing interest. Only disappointment was that the screen has to be stowed during take-off and landing - precisely when the Skycam in the tail is at its most entertaining so you can't watch that part of the proceedings. And finally beware - while these two seats are the best in the cabin for legroom they are also the chilliest. This may be because they are near the galley which has to be cooled or it may be that it's next to the door - though I can't believe this would be the cause of a draught! In any case it was much warmer a few rows forward and we had to cover up well in the excellent blankets to avoid the worst of it and still there was an uncomfortably cool draught on our faces. This was true on both trips (both A380s but different aircraft). So while I'd recommend Premium Economy I'm not sure this is the best place to sit. The ultimate measure is that my wife suffered a lot less from her usual terminal jetlag (we've done this trip quite a lot) and said she would do it again which is not true of 'standard' Economy (there's no going back to Economy now).","A380","2x3x2","","Premium Economy","","8.0","5","4","4","4","5.0","","","1"

However the services desk informed me that if I wanted an exit seat and sat by the window I would not have to pay anything at all - given that there was the section over the door sticking out which would result in my legs being slight angled but not in the way of the passenger next to me. Well worth it and saved me the money and I would recommend anyone wish for more legroom.

The seats were leather with generous leg room, seat pitch too was quite generous. The recline worked well and slid forwards as well as backwards - great sleep support though a tad more recline would've been great. I never usually manage more than 2-3 hours of constant shut eye on an airplane, but I managed to nod off for 6 hrs straight in this economy seat. Given the 3x3x3 config, the aisles were fairly large too.  If I had to crib, it would be the small'ish size of the TV screen, the lack of AC power (USB was available) and how tight the seat pocket flap was!","Boeing 777-300ER","3x3x3","01-07-2015","Economy","Couple Leisure","9.0","5","4","5","5","4.0","3.0","4.0","1"

"singapore-airlines","/seat-reviews/singapore-airlines","Singapore Airlines customer review","R Woodward","Australia","2013-04-20","First of all if you are planning on flying the A380 with SQ I would suggest you get in early and book an upper deck seat. The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips. The aircraft appeared to be new and was very clean and tidy inside. As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil). Changi airport is always a pleasure to use and as mentioned before the customer service with SQ is very good on and off the aircraft.","AIRBUS A380","2x4x2","","Economy","","5.0","3","3","3","2","5.0","","","1"

My seat mate was a large tall gentlemen and he suffered far more than I did. For both of us the seats in row 37 were claustrophobic.

As the last 2 rows are only 2-abreast there is only one person to get past when getting out of your seat (I tend to prefer a window on longhaul as I have a broad upper body and so always tend to get bumped into by passersby on the aisle).","B777-200ER","3x3x3","","Economy","","7.0","4","4","4","3","2.0","","","1"

These are ""preferred"" seats and need to be booked in advance on the SIA website for a charge of $50 per sector. Well worth the extra as there is no one in front of you and the emergency exit does not intrude from the side (as it does on a 747). I think these are actually better that the exit seats further back on the upper deck as no one came up and stood in front of us on either flight whereas further back people milled around waiting for the toilet. The toilets next to our seats were for business class and curtained off so no one came to look out of the window from there. Seat was OK on the outward journey but felt quite hard and was somewhat uncomfortable towards the end of the return flight (This was probably because I had already sat on a 777-200ER for 10 hours with very hard seats!). Flight felt quite hot on the way back (although there were several people with blankets and jumpers so it may just have been me. I did discover 2 fresh air vents around the emergency exit door which improved matters considerably so it is worth looking for these. A380 noticably quieter that the 777.

Seat pitch was good. The problem was the hardness of the seat and a ridge running accross it. The padding was very thin at the back and probably old and compressed (I pulled the seat cushion up to have a look) and there is a pneumatic cushion at the front of the seat so that you can change the thigh support (via a small button on the front left of the seat cushion operating a valve. There is also a similar pneumatic lumbar support). The problem was firstly the hardness of the seat and secondly the junction between the foam and this pneumatic cushion which caused a ridge that cut into my upper thighs. The overall result is a very uncomfortable seat. Both flights had the full AVOD system which was nice and service was good (but not as good as on the A380) as was the food. The seat would not put me off flying SIA again as the A380 was good and staying overnight at Changi was excellent (40 minutes from aircraft arriving at the gate to checking in at the airport hotel and fantastic and incredibly cheap food at the food court on B2 level) but in future I'd try to fly on the 777-300ER which I believe has the same seats as the A380.","B777-200ER","3x3x3","","Economy","","4.0","4","3","4","3","3.0","","","0"

All legs were on time and we found Lisbon Airport a pleasure to transit through. The older A330 had a less advanced entertainment system but did have the nose cam which was great for take off and landing.

I wouldn't recommend paying for business class as the only difference was seats were 2x2 and food was served more regularly. There was only a flimsy partition to separate from economy.

Unfortunately the gate agent informed us, there was no seats available that she was unable to put us together. I need to make it very clear, there was no airplane or equipment change, at least none that I could detect, and the flight was on time. I thought this was an isolated incidence that we were so unlucky to have this occurred on us on both legs. But we met another family that was traveling on different route and dates, they had the similarly but worse experience. They printed the boarding passes the day ahead.

We were seated in 21A and 21C, therefore we had a good view of the TV's. A flaw with United is the movies they show everyone on the overhead TV screens. I was shocked at amount of explicit sexual stuff in the movies, and adding onto that - theft, crime, violence, lots of kissing - in the movies they show. There were toddlers on the flight, and lots of children/teenagers that mostly were on a school trip.

We made the reasonable assumption that IF a passenger pays that much extra they would receive what other airlines provide - several inches of additional legroom. We did not click through to the description US Airways gives that does say no extra legroom is provided. But again paying that much more we made the reasonable assumption that we would receive something more than sitting in the first 3 rows of economy with no additional legroom. We fault US Airways for a very misleading offering. We will try very hard to avoid flying with them again for this reason!

About 2 hours into a flight from Charlotte NC to Phoenix AZ my body was screaming to get out of the seat. My poor husband who is quite tall was miserable as well. This was one flight I couldn't wait to get off of it was that bad. The seat was hard and confining; the leg room stingy. The guy behind me continuously hit my seat back doing what I don't know. The woman in front of me used her seat back to bounce back and forth throughout the entire flight. Why? Because they just didn't have enough room. The space they allot you in your seat is pitiful and painful. Twice I had the cart hit my knee as it was pushed by and several times I had people brush up against me as they walked past because there is so little room in the aisle. Why is this acceptable for air travel? By the time we got off the plane my husband's feet and ankles were severely swollen and he does not normally have a problem with ankle/feet swelling. Really kind of scary the physical abuse you have to tolerate in order to fly from one part of the country to the other. I can't imagine flying on a plane like this on an international flight.

Cabin service on the outward leg was good and attentive (we were told there was a supervisor on board) but I was surprised that the space around the seats was extremely confined and that the in-flight “entertainment” did not work. The distorted sound from the headset made watching any film impossible and the touch-screen system did not allow one to follow even the flight map. Food was just about edible (in spite of what the menu cards promised). It was served in cardboard containers but bedecked with linen tray cloths and a set of cumbersome metal cutlery. The return was another story. On boarding we were warned that alcohol service would be restricted as the outbound flight had virtually drunk the plane dry. Personally I did not find this a problem on a night flight. However cabin service this time was sparse to say the least. With the dinner bread rolls were not offered beyond the first two rows and there was no chance of refilling the miniscule “china” coffee cup. The much-vaunted liqueur service turned out to be a glass of brandy - no choice. Sleep was impossible. The seats had obviously been designed for a greater pitch than had been afforded. If the person in front employed the –limited- possibilities for reclining their seat the surrounding design ensured that you were trapped in yours. If you used the footrest your knees almost hit your chin. Breakfast was similarly awful. I am relieved to say that being at the front of the queue for boarding and disembarkation did have its advantages but I feel obliged to report to others that I regard the Premium Economy service that we received a vast waste of money. One would do far better to purchase extra leg-room seats in Economy Class and investigate taking some of the excellent locally-available snacks to sustain one on the journey. To say this service is over-hyped is an enormous understatement.

There is no lounge access the seats are cramped the service was pretty ordinary - and we felt very disappointed. If this is premium I shudder to think how small the economy seats are. I am not a big person and whilst I could stretch my legs out - the reclined seat in front of me made it almost impossible for me to get in and out. You definitely want an aisle seat - I was in a middle seat. The head rests move when you try to put your head weight against them. I think you would be much better off paying for more legroom and extra luggage in economy if available - it would be cheaper and much the same result.

I can't describe just how restricted the seat was- it was the sort of seat you would expect to sit in on a budget airline short haul flight not a supposedly reputable airline's long haul flight. The chairs in front were practically on top of us and our chairs hardly reclined so needless to say we didn't get any sleep. We had no idea how small these seats would be. Passengers then tried to go and sit in the empty extra legroom seats as the plane was taxiing towards the runway and some minor disputes occurred. The cabin crew did not have a handle on the situation and to our surprise concentrated on taking extra payment from these customers so they could sit in these seats with apparently extra legroom instead of directing them to return to their seats whilst the plane was moving! Overall this was the worst flight we have ever flown on and we are sorely disappointed that Virgin's standards have plummeted.

As another commentator has stated here there is something about these premium economy seats making them just not that comfortable. Perhaps it's the low placement of the foot rest limited recline fatigued cushioning or the adjustable headrest 'wings' which give way as soon as a head rests upon them. An additional issue is the placement of toilets on this plane none of which are in the premium economy section which might be an inconvenience if the plane is full resulting in more demand and a longer occupancy of the aisles by cabin crew performing their duties.

No mention was made to us when checking in that our seats had been switched for 4 centre seats one row from the back of the plane. When we complained we were told firstly it was a light flight and we had been moved to spread the load more evenly but would be able to move to vacant seats once plane had taken off. On the actual flight the captain advised that having received a number of complaints that the upper deck was not being used due to a broken lift. Whatever the reason we had a very uncomfortable flight siting so close to the toilets and subjected to both the toilet smells every time the door opened and people queuing to use the toilet all night. On top of this we were last to receive any food and by this time there was only turkey left and we had no choice of menu by the time service reached us. The final straw was being left with my uncollected breakfast tray despite twice having requested it's removal until a few minutes before we landed when it was finally taken of me.

Virgin Atlantic changed our seat numbers to accommodate a family which is fair enough families should sit together. The seats we were allocated were awful behind the bulkhead seats - D&E. The family immediately reclined their seats and had no consideration for others. It was difficult to see the screen due to the close proximity it was extremely uncomfortable we struggled to get out of the seats due to the recline. Virgin should have put some thought into the fact that we were inconvenienced but they couldn't care less. I feel let down by Virgin and will probably shop around with other airlines in the future. Another annoying factor was that we were in the second to last cabin and there was no hot food choice by the time the cabin staff reached us.

I couldn't even get out to go to the loo there was such little space and spilled drink over myself in the process. It was extremely claustrophobic. I was hoping the return journey would be better but the audio didn't work to my entertainment screen. The flight attendant offered me a portable DVD player which i had to balance on my tray in an already cramped space. I flew virgin premium economy a few years ago and in my opinion they have placed more seats in the area to fit more people in as i don't remember feeling that cramped before.

Very modest incline on the seat certainly no where close to feeling like a natural sleeping position. Just about enough leg room for me as a 5'8 tall man but in some seats the seat mounting will stop you being able to stretch out. Food was average - standard meal tray with a cold starter (pasta salad) rubbery bread roll and a small hot element (either lasagna or chicken) which reminded me of a cheap ready meal. Second meal was a cold snack consisting of a very small sandwich and a very small packet of premium crisps. Other than that got one hot and one cold drink service with and just after the main meal. Our plane had being recently refitted so the new touch screen entertainment system was in place and I have to say this was excellent with a very good selection of recent films and TV. Very small screen but this didn't matter so much in economy as you are never too far away from the seat in front! Other than that the cabin in the 747 was starting to show its age which I guess was not surprising considering it has being flying since 2001. I would not go out of my way to book Virgin again.","BOEING 747-400","3x4x3","","Economy","","3.0","2","2","2","2","4.0","","","0"

The plane had already been delayed by 1.5 hours and we also spent 45 minutes waiting on the ground before we could take off so by that point we felt quite neglected really. The pilot did acknowledge why we had been delayed but stated there had been a “major technical fault” with the plane –In flight my partner’s TV kept cutting out and in the end froze for the remains of the flight so he had to read instead. I had last flown with VA ten years ago and have memories of comfortable seats adequate leg room attentive staff and good food. I do not know what they have done but I felt they have economised on all the above areas. On the return flight to London the pilot was very pleasant and reassuring speaking to us on a few occasions and acknowledging turbulence. Also although the TVs are temperamental the selection available of films and programmes is excellent really. I agree with the person above who suggested that the emphasis is now on PE.

The amenity kit has gone and the meal has been reduced to its most basic form. Anyone who flew Virgin in the good old days would be amazed at what it's turned into.

Started trying to check-in and choose seats 24 hours before departure. Failed on all counts. Called London from hotel four times. Promise made to put note on Boston file but no record of call admitted by ground staff on our arrival at the airport. Row 31 is the first middle group of four seats behind the bulkhead separating Upper from Economy Class. My partner and I are not fat people but we could not fit ourselves comfortably into these extra narrow seats with airbags attached to the safety belts which were using up even more of the limited width. A kind young man offered me his exit seat as I suffer from arthritis in my hip. My partner was not so lucky. She spent the entire night flight with her arms crossed (as the passengers either side of her had taken both arm rests. Virgin Atlantic. Why does Virgin Atlantic online check in system not work and why are they offering four seats on a plane that even slim people cannot sit comfortably in? If any passenger is offered a middle row 31 seat and is larger than a size 8 to 10 for your own good cancel your flight and fly with someone else.","A340","2x4x2","","Economy","","1.0","1","1","1","1","1.0","","","0"

Premium Economy seats have the controls for TV and audio built into the inside of the armrest so cannot be accessed if you are wedged into them. I was unfortunate enough to have a box under the seat in front so could not stretch out at all. My seat was far too narrow for me and I had to keep getting out of it during an 8 hr flight it made my journey horrendous. I upgraded on the return leg to upper class which cost an unacceptable amount but I felt that there was no option. It should be noted that the Premium Economy seating does not have moveable armrests and being fixed makes this worse. Economy seats do have some movement on the armrests but only to 3/4 posiiton.","BOEING 747-400","2x2","","Economy","","1.0","2","3","1","2","2.0","","","0"

What you get is more seat width legroom and recline better service some better food and booze. The problem is that the armrest between the seats takes up a lot of space and cannot be lifted up. So if you travel with kids or even a spouse there's a lost opportunity to get more comfortable. The kids cannot lie with their heads on your lap ever in premium economy. The seats recline more than economy but it doesn't matter. It's still not enough and the seats in general are quite uncomfortable.","Boeing 747-400","2x3x2","","Premium Economy","","4.0","4","3","4","3","4.0","","","0"

I used to fly Virgin very regularly between London and the US but haven't flown with them in the last 4 years and I have definitely noticed that the quality of the seating has deteroriated over that time. It almost feels like you are flying with a budget airline with the way Virgin have tried to cram every spare inch with a seat. I would be interested to know if they have changed the dimensions of the seats and the lefroom in the previous 4 years. The other minus point was the quality of the service The flight attendents could not have been more uninterested if they tried - it was very obvious that all they wanted to do was to feed the passengers and get to the back to chat with the other attendents. I would not fly Virgin again and based on this trip would not recommend them to anyone either.","Boeing 747-400","3x4x3","","Economy","","1.0","1","1","1","2","1.0","","","0"

I checked out the Premium Economy on my way out of the plane and have upgraded for my return flight because couldn't stand another 12-hour flight in those uncomfortable seats. I think they were the hardest I've ever sat on. Felt similar to flying Easy Jet but those are normally a 2 hr flight so your bottom doesn't go numb! I resorted to using my inflatable neck cushion to sit on. The other problem was the lack of a foot rest. Having recently suffered DVT it was important not to have my legs hanging down for 12 hrs (even though I wear stockings and walk around every few hours); Virgin had told me incorrectly that there would be one. I think it's irresponsible to have seats with no foot rests on long haul flights given the incidence of dvts occurring after these flights; raising your legs helps the venous return.
